            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this <hi>Scythian</hi> Monarche, one that for ſtrength, valour and high déeds, held ouer all Pagan Knights and mightie Gyants, chiefe ſoueraigntie, in all military actions, as being of the fearceſt, ſole ſupreme Lord, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Gran Bradamante Campeon:</hi> who procuring to eternize the memory of his linage, deſired to haue a ſonne ſo abſolute in all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, that ioyfully he might paſſe this life, with aſſurance that none but he ſhould imperate all thoſe Orient Iſles, in whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he had ſhead ſo much humane blood.</p>
               <p>To effect which deſire, he begot the moſt mightie <hi>Bramarant,</hi> of himſelfe the onely homecide: as <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> in the firſt Booke of the ſecond part hath recorded.</p>
               <p>With like intent as the Father, departed the ſonne, for ere hee left his Countrey, hée procured it, being in loue with a Gyanteſſe, whoſe fame for valour, did penetrate the vaultie ſkies. With this went hée wondrous gladly to ſpill ſo much Grecian blood, where both Father and Sonne founde theyr Sepulchres in the Gréeke fields.</p>
               <p>Now then dooth <hi>Galtener</hi> record, that compoſed theſe two Parts, howe the Gyanteſſe conceiued by the Famous <hi>Brama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> and at the expiration of her time of trauell, was deliuered of a childe, for ſtrengthe moſte admirable, if not vnmatchable expectation. For nouriſhing and bringing him vp as the proud fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, not with humane milke, but of Ounces, Tygers, and Lyoneſſes, whereof that Iſland yéeldes infinite. At twelue yeares of age, he was as bigge and greate as any Knight of higheſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. No wilde beaſte coulde outrunne him, howe ſwifte ſoeuer hée were: For ſo admirable was the lightneſſe of the ſturdie youth, that hée would ouertake them in their courſe, and with his hands diſioynt them, péece by péece, on whoſe fleſhe hée fedde. Being of fouretéene yeares, hée cauſed an Armour to bee made of ſcales of Fiſh, bredde in the <hi>Arthlanticke</hi> Sea, whoſe ſtrength equalled the fineſt Diamonde: they were ſomewhat darke of colour, but hée garniſht them with Pearles and other riche ſtones, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that they ſéemed naturally to haue growne there. He was not of bodie diſproportioned as other Gyants, but compoſed of ſuch orderly well knit members, that onely in ſtrength he was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gyantiue.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>So when hee ſawe himſelfe with armes, and knewe the <hi>Greekes</hi> had ſlaine his Grandfather, hee ſolemnely prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on the hilts of his ſword, to holde perpetuall enmitie with them. Although preſently arriued other ſorrowfull newes of his fathers death, and how the Gréeke Princes with their owne hands intombde him, vowing to defend his armour againſt any that would preſume to take them.</p>
               <p>This ſomewhat pacified his rage, yet not to eſtéeme them his friends. It gréeued his verie ſoule to heare that the king of <hi>Mauritania</hi> had dared to take away the armour of his deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that hee would ſtay no longer, thinking hee wronged his honour in the deferring of his iuſt reuenge.</p>
               <p>This (aboue all the valianteſt) hee had, that hee was courteous and gentle, and without ſufficient cauſe would neuer vndertake, nor of any euer demaunde the combatte. Arriuing in <hi>Grecia</hi> hee became more milder, not by méeting any that ouermatcht or equalled him in fight, but with the ſole ſight of the Gréekiſh Ladies gallantneſſe.</p>
               <p>Hée was prone to loue, and in purſuite thereof performed no mean ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures. Finally betwéene him and the furious <hi>Bembo,</hi> was all the ſtrength of Paganiſme diuided. Hee tooke his leaue of his ſubiects, (for then he, none was euermore beloued of any) with whom hee left commaundement, that ſtraight vpon report of warre againſt <hi>Greece,</hi> they ſhould with the greateſt power they could aſſemble, ſéeke him there, who onely with the ſon of the Gouernour of his kingdome, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Artanio,</hi> left the confines of <hi>Scythia,</hi> where he raigned, purpoſing to imploy himſelfe in nothing till he met the Mauritanian <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> and to take from him the armes of his ſo deare and valiant father, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe vnfortunafe, in that he had not known him. His ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rigged, and of all munition and tackling well prouided, within one moneth hee entred the vaſte Greeke <hi>Ocean,</hi> which not a little gladded him to be in his enemies countrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:6"/>On the fourth day of his Nauigation (hauing thitherto met with no aduenture woorthie a Hiſtorie) he deſcried making towards him a ſhippe, whereat he reioyced excéedingly, hoping to knowe newes of his demaund. The ſhippes in their méeting came ſo neare, that <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorant</hi> might well diſcerne vpon the hatches of this ſtrangers ſhippe, two knights of gallant diſpoſition, clad in rich and ſtrong Armor, with whoſe ſight he reſted highly contented, for in all his life he had not ſéene better accompliſht Gentlemen. They wore their Helmets off to take the freſhneſſe of the aire, and ſéeing he ioyned his to their ſhippe, they put them on. And he approaching ſaid.</p>
               <p>Sir Knights, I ſhalbe highly fauoured to know neare what land we are, and how farre we be from the nigheſt? Eleuated in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were the two, ſéeing ſo ſtout a youth, for hauing his vyzor raiſed, they ſawe his beard did not as then ſpring foorth. The one replied, you now do nauigate ſir knight in the Gréekiſh ſea, and are not aboue thrée daies ſailing from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for ſo many is it ſince we thence departed. In curteſie then tell me (required the ſturdie youth) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that ſlew the <hi>Gran Campeon Bradaman,</hi> be now in that Citie, for it greatly concernes me to méete with him? And I cannot beléeue, nor is it poſſible, that onely one to one he ſhould ouercome him, whom all the Orientall Regions feared. The other anſwered, That Prince is in <hi>Greece</hi> (Knight) and if you proue your ſelfe with him, you ſhall finde that was nothing he then did, ſo great is his valiantneſſe and vnmatched ſtrength, whereto the heauens ioyned all their influences to make it incomparable.</p>
               <p>To heare the Gréeke ſo praiſed, did excéedingly vexe the youth. So the Pagan replied ſaying. Surely if all in <hi>Greece</hi> be as valiant in fight, as they are ſingular in their Princes praiſes, they cannot be leſſe eſtéemed then for the wonders of Chiualry, and in the world ſoly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for déeds in armes.</p>
               <p>So are they indéed (replied the knight) and he that dares gaine ſay it, I here defie him to mortall battell. Defie me (anſwered he) Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens! is this tollerable I heare? that before I ſée the countrie of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, there ſhould bee any to dare me and challenge me? therefore no longer would the inraged Pagan ſtay, but commaunding his barke to be grappled cloſe with his aduerſaries, hee drewe foorth his furious blade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:6"/>Againſt <hi>Mars</hi> would not the other refuſe the combat, but in this gets he little: for being with triall aſſured of the Pagans ſtrength, hée ſtraight imagined what ſmall honour hee ſhould get in that attempt. For the raging <hi>Scythian</hi> raiſing his <hi>Merculean</hi> arme, &amp; as that was the firſt blowe, ſo would he make it notable, which indéed was ſuch a one, that lighting on the top of his helme, hee ſliſed away the one half, with part of the neck-péece, and deſcended on his ſhoulder with ſuch waight, that he thought a Tower had fallen thereon: which made him fall vnto the ground vpon his handes, looſing a péece of his vanbrace. Another ſeconded the new <hi>Mars,</hi> leſſening the former with the furie of the latter, lighting on him as he roſe in the middle of his ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſhield, which as if it had béene made of a thin plate, was cleane cut from the one to the other end, and the blowe fearcely falling on his ſight, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, felled him al along vpon the barke, voyding much blood throgh his noſe and mouth.</p>
               <p>An Eagle in lightneſſe was the Pagan, ſo would he follow leaping after him: but the ſupreme guider of the Orbes did otherwiſe appoint it, moouing his companion to ſuccour him with incredible ſeleritie, making the <hi>Scythians</hi> of none effect, by giuing him a venturous thruſt on the ſturdie breaſt, making him recoyle backewards: for had he lept into their ſhippe, both had left their liues in the handes of the angrie Pagan, who like a furious Baſſeliſke offered againe the daungerous leape, but to prohibit him, ſtood the amorous <hi>Floriſarte,</hi> for it was he and his father, with the diſguiſed Princeſſes that were there, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Greece,</hi> were brought to that paſſe, that they accounted themſelues ſurely vanquiſhed, ſo fierce ſéemed the <hi>Scythian.</hi> By this was the father riſen, reioycing at the good ayde his ſonne had giuen him. Againe reioyned the two barkes, and their beeing both togither, increaſed their hopes of victorie.</p>
               <p>The haughtie youth refuſed them not, but rather ioyed thereat, iudging them Knights of eſtimation, and ſince ſo valiant tokens they ſhewed thereof, he thought that vanquiſhing them, ſome honour he might atchieue by the conqueſt. He was inraged againſt the ſome for diſturbing him from winning the enterance of their ſhip: and ſo ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a mightie blow, that had he not bene <hi>Brauorant</hi> that receiued it, no other could haue the heart to endure the ſecond.</p>
               <p>At his pleaſure did he reache the beloued <hi>Floriſarte</hi> on the one
<pb facs="tcp:13978:7"/>
ſide of his ſhield. Farre did not the ſword enter, for the Scythian ſtaied his arm, but all that it reached, which was the ſhield it ſnatcht fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hands, making him turne twice or thrice about, like with ſtaggering to fall: he ſtept nigher to the edge, to diſcharge another, which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as he would: for taking him about the ſhoulders, the blade boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpwards, elſe it had ſtrooke away his head: but ſo puiſſant was the furious ſtroake, that it diſarmed all that ſide, and fell with ſuch huge heauie ſtrength, that it ſtrooke him downe in the middle of the barke.</p>
               <p>Like a ſwelling ſerpent became the father, ſéeing his ſonne ſo handled, that with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength he diſcharged his rage vppon the <hi>Gygantine</hi> youth, who not reſpecting it, would not ward it (but to bée giuen by the hands of the valiant Tharcian) it was too much proude confidence to reſpect it: which made him ſée more ſtarres then the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Firmament contained. He ſtaggered too vnſéemely ſteppes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, almoſt falling, but recouering himſelfe, he fomed through the Vyzor like a hunted Boore: blaſpheming irreligiouſly againſt his goddeſſe.</p>
               <p>By this time came the ſonne, and knowing that one onely knight handled them in that manner, with both his hands hee laid vpon his Helme, which ſounded like a bell. In all his life he had not receiued the like: for it made him bend his head with no litle paine: and with more ſpéed then he would, euen to his breſt. Scarcely had the ſonne execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his, when the father diſcharged an other in the ſame place. They forced him to ſet his hands on the ground: It was to their will, for returning more furious then a hunted Lyon in his greateſt rage, as he roſe, with a counterbuffe he tumbled the father on the middeſt of his backe, ſo ſore bruſed with the blowe, that almoſt hee could not after ſtand on his féete. The ſonne maintained the fight, procuring rather to defend himſelfe from the Pagans fierce blowes, then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
               <p>But what auaileth it? for the father being arriued in his helpe, their aduerſary neuer fully reached them any blowe, but he lanched forth their blood, wherwith they both were withal couered, and althogh they had ſomewat wearied and more inraged him, yet was his Armor neither cut nor raſed, and had the battle béene made on land, it had
<pb facs="tcp:13978:7"/>
ere this bene ended, either with death or vanquiſhment of both. For the haughtie youth was borne to fight, finding eaſe therein: and ſo had he in the ende of thrée houre, ſo tyred and wounded them, that longer they could ſcarce holde out: Yet for all this, did not the Knights looſe any part of their courage, which was ſuch, that they forced the ſon of <hi>Bramarant</hi> to increaſe in forces, bellowing like a bayted Bull: and yet highly eſtéeming them, in reſpect of their ſhewen valour.</p>
               <p>Long hadde hee deſired to winne their ſhippe, and ſo now to acccompliſh the ſame: with a thruſt, hee draue the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentarian</hi> Prince to the fartheſt ſide of it, and after him woulde hee haue leapt, if that a ſuddaine whirle-winde that happened, hadde not parted farre aſunder both ſhippes, following after it, ſo great a miſty thicke fogge, with ſo much thundring and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the prowdeſt heart was daunted with feare.</p>
               <p>Which beeing paſt, they ſawe themſelues ſo ſundred, that ſtraight eyther loſt the ſight of the other, and in the Princes Shippe, immeaſurable was their griefe for the two Pages loſſe, that in that tempeſt were conueyed away: inſomuch, that the amorous <hi>Floriſart</hi> was like to runne madde with ſorrowe: and it was not much, for none (liuing) was euer better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>Heere their friende <hi>Nabato</hi> would not leaue them with ſuch paine, ſo hee appeared to them in theyr Barke, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Valiant Princes, there is no cauſe why you ſhuld gréeue at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens decrée, and what is directed according to their will: and thinke it not little that you haue ſuſtained your ſelues ſo long againſt that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: for there be fewe on the earth ſo valiant as he: and let this be no ſtrangeneſſe to aggrauate your mindes, for it will alwaies redound to to the honor of <hi>Greece.</hi> Touching the Pages, it was time they ſhould returne to whom ſent them: and therefore ſorrow not, for they are in place where they ſhall bee entreated as their perſons do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>
               <p>And you gallant <hi>Floriſart,</hi> that haue moſt reaſon of gréef, take courage: for only it muſt moſt aduance your immortall honor. And one day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:8"/>
leaſt you thinke of your glory, you ſhall be challenged to obſerue and performe your promiſe giuen to <hi>Artimio,</hi> accounting (through the great content you then ſhall receiue) all the troubles and tormenting paſſions you ſhall henceforth thitherto endure (which will not be few) to be but the paſſage of ſo many pleaſures: but againſt many others that may befall you, your valour and fortitude is very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as you bee arriued at <hi>Argentaria</hi> (for ſo it behooueth the eaſe and quietneſſe of <hi>Roſabell</hi>) with the greateſt Fléete of ſhips and gallyes (detracting no time) that you may make ready, take your courſe towards the Chappell of Saint <hi>George.</hi> For in deſpite of our mortall and great enemie <hi>Lupercio,</hi> Ile place a ſignall on <hi>Lyrianas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment, that thereby you may repaire thither, ſéeing it a very far off: and let there be no negligent forgetfulneſſe herein, for it toucheth no leſſe then the Ladies libertie, to be done by Gréekes and their friends, by the happie comming of the vnknowne <hi>Lyon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereupon he tooke his leaue, ending his ſpéech, and departed from them. Who no ſooner landed in their dominions, and being receiued with the loue that <hi>Flora</hi> did beare them, they gaue order for all what the wiſeman had told them, gathering togither of both kingdoms thrée hundred royall gallies, well prouided with moſt warlike men, and all manner of other neceſſarie munition. What they did, ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>For thrée miles from <hi>Rome</hi> appeared a moſt ſtrange inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, making at the fixing ſo mightie a noiſe, that all the Vallies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about did reſound, and that famous Citie trembled with the ſound. The Emperor was amazed, not knowing the cauſe of that ſudden earth-quake: But after a while there came a Knight that told him, how in the Forreſt there was to bee ſéene a great and woondrous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of maruellous and ſeldome ſéene worke: and that hauing read cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain letters written on a Pillar, he perceiued it to be the inchauntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Princeſſe <hi>Roſelia.</hi> Great contentment receiued her father and mother, to know newes of their deare daughter, hauing thitherto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her dead: hoping now aſſuredly to ſée her, ſince ſhe was brought to ſuch a place. <hi>Nabato</hi> did comfort them, ſaying: The time would come, they ſhould ſée her, receiuing more ioy then at that inſtant they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:8"/>So he departed from them, procuring the diſinchaunting of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> (and ſée if thereby the great warres might be appeaſed, which he imagined would about her happen) to eſpouſe her to <hi>Roſabel,</hi> and as he thought, he preſently put it in execution, ſetting in deſpight of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percio,</hi> (hauing greater ſkil then he) on the top of the maruellous To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, a burning Cloud, flaming ſo mightily, that it ſéemed continually to caſt vpwards flames of inextinguable fire. It was ſéene farre off, and therefore there were fewe vppon the ſeas but repaired thither, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without it, there had not failed to come the famous <hi>Bembo,</hi> with the Souldan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was a brother to him ſlaine, yet farre more ſtronger. Neither at his due time wanted the great Lord of <hi>Nyquea</hi> himſelfe, with a mightie Fléete. For <hi>Lupercio</hi> found that Gréeke Prince ſhould end the aduenture, and maugre all the world, beare away <hi>Lyriana:</hi> and to forbid that no other Knight might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to proue the aduenture, he ſtirred vp and mooued the valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Knights in the whole vniuerſe againſt the Gréekes, as hereafter ſhall at large be expreſt. And yet by the ſigne, the great Magician <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato</hi> ſet, all the flower of <hi>Grecia</hi> vnited, was there aſſembled. The mightie <hi>Brauorant</hi> could not but ſée it, for parting from the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Princes, his Galley ſo nauigated the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that he ſawe the fearefull flames that iſſued from the Sea. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſée ſuch ſtraunge aduentures, was the ſtout and fierce Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and to proue himſelfe therein, ioying to haue left his Countrey, to participate of his begunne ſights, imagining that his ſtrong and valiant arme was ſufficient to terminate ſuch a déede, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thither to be directed, where quickly he arriued, amazed to ſée the Tower and the maruellous workemanſhip thereof, vnable to conceiue who could frame ſo admirable a thing. He read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuperſcriptions, &amp; not regarding what Armes were required for that attempt, he flung (as <hi>Bembo</hi> had done) at one of the Pillers whereon the Tower was built: but at that inſtant, there aroſe ſo much fire, that all his fury &amp; ſtrength nothing auailing him, with want inough thereof he gaue ouer, where his Armour ſtood him in no ſmall ſtéed, for being made of thoſe bones that are moſt colde, they were able to defend ſome part of the heate of that fire, and blaſpheming on his Goddes, he ſtood looking if he could finde any other entrance: and ſéeing none, he thought it beſt to depart, vowing to returne thither, and defend that none other ſhould trie it,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:9"/>
ſince he had not ended it, it coſt many liues: and to performe it, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his Pylot to make towardes <hi>Mauritania,</hi> for he deſired to be there, to demaund his fathers Armes of <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> or looſe his life in their purſuite. The weather was faire, calme, and proſperous, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring his voyage, for in eight daies he landed there: he was glad thereof, and ſo tooke foorth a mightie roane Courſer, the beſt that all his Countrey did affoord, of ſuch force, as it eaſily might beare the ſturdie youth. On another mounted his Squier <hi>Artanio,</hi> and taking the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt path, he beganne to pace foorth in haſte, to learne of ſome one, if the king of that lande were there to ſéeke him. Straight was he aſſured ther of, reioycing greatly thereat, being perſwaded none could diſturbe him from winning the Armour that once belonged to his deare father. But to reſt himſelfe, he entered through a faire Forreſt, paſſing that day there, til it was time to ſléepe, which was but little, by reaſon of that which befell him.</p>

               <p>I had not thought (replied the Pagan) that through intreating thée, with what amongſt good knights is vſed, ſhould haue put thée in that arrogant confidence, as to néede none others ayde, beeing a thing ſo contrarie to reaſon. If thou kneweſt the lawe of Loue (replied the Knight) thou ſhould knowe there is no happineſſe therein, but to loue with ſecrecie, for that is it that aſſureth any doubtfull hope. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my cares to one that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not redreſſe them, with more then a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (I am ſorrie) we ſigh more in hauing a ſtraungers companie, then for diſcret circumſpectneſſe.</p>
               <p>It cannot be expreſt what rage the Pagan conceiued, for being inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently bolde, he was onely noted of immoderate raſhneſſe, and ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Then, that thou mayeſt know that to haue told it me was thy aduantage, I ingage thée to the battell, that by taking away thy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling life, the paines whereof thou doeſt complaine, may alſo end. <hi>Mars</hi> was not more fierce then the Louer, beeing angered, and ſo without longer ſtay, drew foorth one of the worlds beſt blades. Mightie hee was: but hee met with that ſtrength whereto <hi>Mylos</hi> forces neuer reacht, through conceiued rage he was quicker in executing his blow, diſcharging it on the ſhield, of which to the ground hee threwe a péece, beating the reſt ſo heauily on his heade, that it almoſt aſtoniſhed him. He ſtept in with his right foote, and with a ſteddie ſtrong thruſt he forſt him with ſtaggering paces backwards: he wold not yet leaue the chaſe for turning his ſword vnderhand, let it flie at his right thigh, making his aduerſaries fleſh féele the cutting of his ſharpe blade.</p>
               <p>Neuer was Serpent in the deſert <hi>Libia</hi> more rigorous then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now did returne vpon the knight, and where he thought his blow
<pb facs="tcp:13978:11"/>
would be of more effect, thither hee ſtrucke: the other raiſed his ſhield, but it was of no defence, for although hee did not cut it, through the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the temper, yet it ſo charged him, that hee ſet his hands on the ground, and ere hee roſe, hee felt another, which made him thinke hee ſawe the ſtarrie firmament.</p>
               <p>The blood congealed in his mouth, and fréezed in his bodie, ſéeing the fierceneſſe of the Pagan, which hee thought farre to excéede the Gréeke Princes. He roſe vp, for hee was couragious, minding to vſe his nimbleneſſe, but as therein the <hi>Scythian</hi> excéeded the ſwiftneſſe of any Hart, it auaild him not from receiuing moſt cruell blowes, kiſſing the earth ſometimes with his knées, and ſometimes with his handes. Neuer felt he himſelfe ſo perſecuted, nor at the poynt to looſe the fame he had obtained for valour, and therefore did hee redouble his blowes ſo ſtrong and thicke, that the Pagan was forced to deuiſe newe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue wards. Excéedingly he reioyced to ſée what braue knights he met in his iourney towards the parts of <hi>Grecia,</hi> déeming him of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, where the Authors of his life were intombde.</p>
               <p>This remembrance ſo vext him, that hee ſuppoſed it cowardiſe to continue in ſingle combat ſo long: ſo letting a blowe flie aloft, hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the ſeconde with ſuch mightie ſtrength on his aduerſaries helme, that it rezounded like a bell: and not able to penetrate it, ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily it waighed on one ſide, that breaking all the laces, buckles, and riuets, it ſtrucke it from his head, making the knight vpholde himſelfe with his handes: but at his riſing <hi>Apollos</hi> beautie ſéemed not ſo faire that day, as <hi>Floralizas</hi> great <hi>Alicandros</hi> Néece, that wandring throgh ſtraunge lands in ſearch of her <hi>Poliphebo,</hi> had arriued there. In all his life did not the Pagan receiue ſuch a blowe (as with her ſight) for in all the ſame, he forgot not the memorie of that day: hee ſtayed his ſword, and ſtepping foorth, vnlaced his helme, ſetting to view his ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die viſage, more faire then ſwartie, yet with many wrinkled checkes, and one great mole on his front, approoued tokens of his exceſſiue ſtrength, his ſhield he caſt away, and taking his ſword by the poynt, (through the newe tuch of loue) hee ſpake with more ciuilitie then the moſt amorous.</p>
               <p>Admired Goddeſſe, I beſéech you pardon my mad preſumption, although I féele alreadie the puniſhment thereof, for the not knowing
<pb facs="tcp:13978:11"/>
you, forced me to it, yet I repute it well, if it redownde not to your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpleaſure, which will be to me a more vnhappier death, in that I haue ſéene the excellencie of beautie and valour: and ſo intreate you, as deſeruer of farre more honour, you will accept my ſword in ſigne of victorie, and Ile defend that all the world doth owe it you. It greatly delighted the Ladie to ſée the knights courteſie, and imagining he was of eſtéeme, replied. I will not (ſir knight) haue you in all things take the better of the fight, for the victorie is yours, leauing not thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your content. Her handes to kiſſe then required the newe <hi>Mars,</hi> thinking no greater good might bee expected then the preſent. Shée drew them from him, demanding who he was? So yoaked was the Pagan, that he could not denie it, nor through contemplation ſay any thing, yet thus he ſpake.</p>
               <p>There was no reaſon (diuine Goddeſſe) to intreate, what by commaunding makes me happie in obedience. I am called <hi>Brauorant,</hi> ſonne to that famous <hi>Bramarant,</hi> which in <hi>Greece</hi> was deathes man to himſelfe, and Nephewe to that <hi>Campeon,</hi> which loſt his life by the hands of a Gréeke Prince (although I cannot beléeue it) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I left my countrie, of purpoſe to be reuenged on the Gréeks and the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> king, whoſe land we now tread, becauſe hee tooke away my fathers armour: and alſo I come to know the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> whoſe vaſſaile I am, and greateſt friend in reſpect of the loue that he and the mightie <hi>Midinaro</hi> his Grandfather did beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my kindred. And this is all I can ſay, praying the like, not in regard of my relation, but that I may know my Soueraigne. Bound thereto was the Ladie, replying thus.</p>
               <p>I greatly deſire to knowe my ſtocke, and whom I am, that I might therein ſatiſfie your content (braue <hi>Brauorant:</hi>) and I aſſure you, that the moſt I knowe, is, that I knowe not whom I am, more then that a brother of mine and my ſelfe, were brought vppe togither in a wood, without other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation then of a wiſe man, that did inſtruct vs in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, whom wee reputed our father, till hee aſſured vs the contrarie, and through the accidents befallen, ſome haue tolde vs wee are the children of that ſo loued Prince <hi>Meridian.</hi> More I knowe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:12"/>I beléeue no leſſe, but that thoſe which are the earths chief lights (aunſwered the amorous <hi>Scythian</hi>) deriue their diuine diſcent from the heauens, whence your ſacred Grandfather procéeds. As they were in this conuerſation, they ſawe him comming whom they ſoght, mounted on a mightie Courſer, he wore not then the armour of that <hi>Mars</hi> and mightie <hi>Bramarant,</hi> kéeping them onely to weare in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> the more to deſpight her Princes.</p>
               <p>The Ladie knewe him, and tolde it the fierce Pagan, that cried out for ioy, ſaying. This aduenture (excellent Ladie) admits compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſolely with that of your knowledge. Now am I certaine of all good fortune, ſince the heauens haue ſet before mine eyes with ſo ſmal toyle the thing I moſt deſired.</p>
               <p>He aroſe with angrie paces, and called for his fierce horſe. The like did the Ladie, lightly vawting into the ſaddle. The <hi>Scythian</hi> was nothing enuious thereat, for in lightneſſe the <hi>Orientall</hi> nations affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not his péere, and brandiſhing his lance, made againſt the <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanian:</hi> but what happeneth deſcribeth the next Chapter.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13978:12"/>
how thereby he angred the Gréeke Princes, yet no matter for this (I ſéeke not their contents) but thou ſhouldſt imagine, that a ſenne, of his liuing, greater was the wrong to take them, ſince they were his right, guiding thy ſelfe thereto more by inſolencie, then the dutie of a knight.</p>
               <p>Neuer did the barbarous <hi>Sarazin</hi> nation know a more prouder Pagan then the king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and ſuppoſing him like to others he had tried, with a fearefull voyce hee replied. What, cowarde knight, thinkeſt thou that méeting with thoſe armes, I would through feare leaue them, although I did incenſe the heauens, and anger euery one the earth contained? Oh, I wiſh I had them here to weare them in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of my valours victorie, making the powers of heauen knowe to thy coſt, no terrene merits better deſerues to weare them then <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro.</hi> Milde in the beginning was the <hi>Scythian,</hi> but being moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to rage, no Baſſeliſke is like to him, ſo roring like a bull, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his horſe, caſting his eyes vp to the ſkie, ſaid.

So great was their rage, that the one could neither proſecute his ſpéech, nor the other make reply, leauing to their handes what their tongues could not vtter.</p>
               <p>Now would I here (but I know not how I may) againe implore your ſacred helps (admired Ladies of vnſpotted purities) but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue euermore tuned with this one vocal note, daſht my thoghts in their expected hopes.

With trembling feare doo I once againe awaite your cenſures: Oh, in regard of their immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late triple trinitie graunt it, be it but vnder the couert of a fained ſmile: whoſe obtained imagination ſwifter then the winde, brought the ſterne combattants to incounter with more noyſe, then <hi>Vulcans</hi> thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boltes do rent the clowdie ayre amidſt their furious paſſage, or fiercer then the tempeſteous waues raiſed by the vnbridled rage of a ſea-ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning whirlewinde, beate on the flintie rockes: yet was it nothing in reſpect of the horrour that theſe two rare in armes committed with their launces. Of knottie Oake were they, but arriuing at the breſt, brake as they were of weake cane or ſmall reedes: either paſt by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without motion, although the Moore at his turning about, throgh the aſtoniſhment of the ſhocke loſt his right ſtirrope. Aloft with their ſwords raiſed togither, they diſcharged them on their helms with more force, then doth a waterie current deſcending from a ſtéepie hill breake through a riuers locke.</p>
               <p>Venturous was the <hi>Mauritanians</hi> blowe, for it lighted on the toppe of his plumed creſt, ſtriking away all the ſtéeled circuite, with part of the maled gorget, &amp; on his ſhoulder praide the furious ſword, falling ſo heauily, that he bowed belowe his horſe necke. On the ſhield did the fierce youth ſtrike the <hi>Mauritanian,</hi> it is no defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rigorous arme, for the halfe it tooke away, making him ſhake like an Aſpen leafe. They were both moſt ſkilfull, ſo turned they to ſecond others, and the <hi>Affricanian</hi> let flie a poynt, which the youth ſurely felt, who reacht him ere he could fetch home his arme, with a croſſe counterbuffe on the ſide of his helme, that all that part he left diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, ouerturning him more then hee willingly would on his left ſtirrope: it was no occaſion to be loſt, ſo aſſalting with his ſword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before he could ward it, did giue another no leſſe dangerous on his ſight, ſo mightie, that the blood guſht from his noſe.</p>
               <p>Neuer was troden Serpent more rigorous then now the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> returned, that ſeeing himſelfe ſo handled, cruſhing one tooth with another, with his blade mounted on high, executed on his helme ſuch a blowe, that it almoſt ſtrooke him ſenceleſſe. Hee well perceiued his alteration, ſo tooke he the aduantage entring with a cruell thruſt, had not his armes béene as they were, there had the battell ended: but they were ſo ſtrong, that the ſword could not enter them, ſo ſliding thence,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:13"/>
it lighted twixt the buckles of his breſt, cutting down his ſtrong male, and he was happie to ſhrinke his bodie to himſelfe, elſe hee had béene mortally wounded. He paſt his carrier ſo ſwiftly, that the <hi>Scythian</hi> could not ſtrike him when he wold. With ſuch nimblenes returned the haughtie <hi>Affrican,</hi> that his courage amazed the inuincible youth. But now was hee at the vtmoſt of his rage, and willing to make it known, caſting his ſhield at his backe, let driue at him a moſt mightie blowe. Ward it with his ſword and the remnant of his ſhielde would the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican:</hi> it was of no defence, for from one to the other end it was clean diuided in two, and méeting with his ſword, both made ſo cruell a ſtroke on his helme, that though it contained two fingers in thickneſſe, he gaue him a perilous wound on his left ſide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mauritanian</hi> would not deſerre his payment, for cloſing his ſword firmly, and ſéeing him without ſhield, diſcharged the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of his armes on his ſure helme, it was it ſaued his life, and his head from cleauing: neuertheleſſe it was ſo heauie, that it ſtrooke him along vpon his courſers backe, redoubling another vppon his broad breaſt, that it almoſt ſtopt the paſſage of his breath. Admirable was the ſight of the more then cruell fight: for <hi>Apollo</hi> hauing made his courſe vnto the middeſt of the vaultie heauens, there ſtayed to gaze vpon their warre, glad to ſée the warriours, that without ſigne of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, had foure houres maintained their fierce combat. Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better ſped the <hi>Scythian,</hi> by reaſon of his inpenitrable armes that kept his bodie from cutting. Which was not ſo with the <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanian,</hi> for in ſome places was he ſore hurt, but yet was no cauſe to make him ſhewe any faintneſſe, &amp; it rather increaſed his courage to ſée his blood inamell the earth. Amazed ſtood the gallant Ladie to viewe the Pagans battel, iudging the worlds whole ſtrength was twixt theſe two reparted. Greatly ſhe deſired to giue order in parting them, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with the death of any <hi>Greece,</hi> ſhe loſt one of the valianteſt and greateſt enemies ſhe had. This toucht her verie ſoule: yet would ſhe not ſéeme to diſgrace the mightie <hi>Brauorant:</hi> ſo ſhee againe regazed on the fight, thinking in the end he would get the better, ſeeming moſt Maiſter thereof. He gaue the other a blowe ere ſhe could terminate her preſumption, vppon his helme, that in a trance hee ſtrooke him on his horſe crupper. A while was he carried ſo about the field, yet not ſo long, that he might ſecond another ere hee recouered himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:14"/>Who like a Hercanian Tiger, with his ſword twixt both handes, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his rage vpon his ſhield: ſo mightily did it ioyne with his head, that it aſtoniſht him, and with another almoſt ouerthrewe him. The raging mountain Lyoneſſe wanting her whelps, is like a milde lambe, compared with the puiſſant matchleſſe <hi>Scythian,</hi> that renouncing his Gods with execrable blaſphemies, ſpurd againſt the Moore, and ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was he in his carrier, that he cloſed ſo neare hee could not execute his blowe, more then caſt his armes about him with ſuch power, that he ſnatcht him from his ſaddle, whoſe waight foreſt him to leaue his ſtirropes &amp; leape after him, falling both on the hard ground, with more ſtrength they imbraced then doth the tender Iuie incompaſſe about the ſturdie Oake.</p>
               <p>A good while tumbled they vp and downe the earth, till ſéeing neither could ſo vanquiſh his aduerſarie, at once they parted, repairing to their weapons, whoſe ſight once more might ſatiſfie any minde of the like deſire: for if the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> be nimble, the <hi>Scythian</hi> is a Roe in ſwiftneſſe.</p>
               <p>Here might <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe learne as in a ſchoole, and with milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie principles gorge his ſight. For being a foote on ground, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, to note the dexteritie wherewith they aſſaulted, and ſkilful manner of retires. More noyſe made they then <hi>Vulcans Cyclopean</hi> workemen. Thrée houres of the afternoone were paſt, and they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of any loſſe, redoubled their blowes as in the beginning. More vſed to armes was the Moore: but the youth was borne with his ſtéeled coate, finding eaſe amiddeſt the greateſt warre: ſo beganne hee to vaunt of his aduantage to the <hi>Mauritanians</hi> coſte, that beeing wounded, beganne to faint, yet not ſo plainly, but would diuers times put his battell in hazard.</p>
               <p>By this would <hi>Tytans</hi> ſhining beames obſcure his ſplendor, dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it in the Spaniſh <hi>Ocean,</hi> when the Ladie apparantly ſawe the aduantage on <hi>Brauorants</hi> partie, and iudged him ſufficiently hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therewith, leapt from her horſe, and ſtepping betwéene them, ſaid. Apart, apart, braue warriours, for it is no reaſon about a trifle of ſo ſmall importance, you ſhould make the world Orphant of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Captiuated was the Pagan in the giues of his Ladies gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he replied thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:14"/>Heroicke Knight, though in ſome reſpect I be herein wronged, I wil not worke your diſcontent, and do leaue the battle in this eſtate. I take vpon me valiant knight (ſaid he) the wrong offered you (if it be any to leaue the fight) and I doubt not but this knight wil take it well to ceaſe it at this time.</p>
               <p>Well perceiued the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> he might be fully perſwaded now to haue the worſt, ſo he anſwered, he was content, and they ſhould not want another time to ende it. Thankfull vnto him for it was <hi>Florali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and offering him her friendſhip, the Moore departed, bearing with him inough to talke off in his Citie, of the <hi>Scythians</hi> courage. They ſat them downe, and the youth tooke off his helme: the like did the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, diſcourſing of <hi>Brufaldoros</hi> brauery. This vertue among the reſt, greatly adorned <hi>Brauorant,</hi> that he neuer tooke from any the merites that he thought him worthie of. So was he firſt in giuing a beginning to <hi>Brufaldoros</hi> praiſes. No better medicine could come to the luſtie youth, then the ſight of that humane Goddeſſe, whoſe bewtie had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted his ſences, that he iudged her all diuine.</p>
               <p>He was not conſtant, for ſeeing the Gréeke Ladies, he ſtraight forgot <hi>Floraliza,</hi> only the ſupremacy of bewtie, making change in him. Moſt part of the night paſt they with different thoughts: for the Pagan was ſoly ouerwhelmed in Contemplation of the Ladies graces, not daring to manifeſt his glorie, for yet he was not ſufficiently toucht with loues fierie euil.</p>
               <p>The Lady though ſhe was glad to haue ſuch company, were it but becauſe he was an enemy to the Gréekes, anſwered with her toong what her heart felt not, which ſhe had left in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian,</hi> whoſe abſence was able to diſtract her, thinking ſhe ſhould not ſée him any more. It is eaſie for the ſoule to beléeue the euil it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted too, for as it liues fearful and in doubt of the deſired good, any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary accident that happens, taketh firme poſſeſſion of the Louer.</p>
               <p>In this conuerſation were the vncontrowled <hi>Brauorant</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, when they heard a great noyſe like the fighting of many knights, they tooke their way towards it, neuer finding out where it was. For the Magitian <hi>Lupercio,</hi> had deuiſed it to conduct the Pagan to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the maruellous Tower. So loſt he the Lady which ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greeued him, that he had almoſt loſt his wits: wandring thrée dayes vp and downe thoſe woods calling for her, yet could heare no tydings,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:15"/>
till thinking ſhe was ſhipt to ſea, he with his Page <hi>Artanio</hi> did the like. He arriued at the Tower, where he made his abode to the coſt of many Fames, ſending thoſe that went with him in the ſhippe, to the land for his neceſſary prouiſion. Where for this time we leaue him, till other occaſion that wil miniſter matter inough of his valiantneſſe, and the Lady in ſearch of <hi>Polliphebo,</hi> returning to <hi>Eſclauonia,</hi> for in ſo long delaie, we mightily haue wronged the Princeſſe <hi>Venus.</hi>

               <p>Thou ſayeſt well (anſwered the Gréeke) for in the end according to their neceſſitie, they were ſuccoured with the valour of this knight, to whom the palme of the victorie is due. I wil not agrée thereto Syr knight (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Dacian</hi>), ſince the experience you haue this day ſhowne of your vnconquered arme, witneſſeth againſt any that on my behalfe may be alleaged. But leauing this (alreadie alighted from their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) it will glad my very ſoule, to knowe who hath this day inacted ſo many wonders.</p>
               <p>In compariſon of yours (ſaid the Gréeke) warlike Prince of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> mine are of ſo ſmall name, that they may boaſt of nothing more, then to be atchiued by the fauours of your preſence, whoſe imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge that <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia</hi> went in my defence, made me draw ſtrength from my weaknes, to ſhewe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at leaſt in ſomething
<pb facs="tcp:13978:15"/>
I may reſemble to be your kinſman.</p>
               <p>And therevpon he did put off his helme, procéeding. I ſhould wrong the <hi>Darian</hi> Lord, not to tell him who hath this day receiued ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ayde. His vncle did ſtraight knowe him, and with a ioyfull voyce embracing him, ſaid. Vntill the death ſhall I complaine mee of this wrong (moſt excellent Prince of <hi>Greecia</hi>) in ſo long delaying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent I ſhould receiue by knowing you. For had I been witting of ſuch deare companie, I had ſtill conceiued more aſſurance of the victorie.</p>
               <p>My ſelfe being armed with that aſſurance, Heroicke Prince (replied the Gréeke) made me reſerue till now my diſcouerie, purpoſing ſtill fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning to do it til the battell ended, of whoſe good ſucceſſe I nothing doubted ſeeing you therein: and that you may bee aſſured by what meanes you haue bound me to your obſeruance, know, that the combat was made for my libertie, being called in this countrie the D<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing Knight, whoſe Princeſſe taking pittie of my wrong impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, procured meanes to liberate me, and found one difficult y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, which was, to let me out through her garden, and gaue mée this armour, that I diſguiſed, might for my ſelfe demaund the battell: and ſince it hath ſo happened to our content, let vs procure it for that Ladie, by againe preſenting my ſelfe in her handes, your ſelfe beeing witneſſe thereof, for in nothing wronging the beautious <hi>Roſamonde,</hi> little is aduentured therein. It is iuſt (replied the <hi>Dacian</hi>) braue <hi>Claridiano,</hi> that herein all our friends and kinſfolkes ayde vs: and let vs go, for whoſoeuer ſtayes, any delay is hurtfull. Let vs away (ſaide the Gréeke) for more then is done reſteth to be executed, and in affairs wherein our hands muſt be inured. For know, that this Ladie (one of the worlds beauties) is inamored of the ſuſpitious knight, who is the Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> that is priſoner, whoſe amitie made me promiſe a thing inhumane, reaſon almoſt impoſſible, that maugre all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I would ſet her in his hands, but now I ſée fortune hath broght it to more facilitie, conducting you hither: and I aſſure you, that his nobleneſſe and friendſhip deſerueth any kindneſſe: wherto the <hi>Dacian</hi> ſpake. It is ynough to effect it (Heroicke Prince) if you haue promiſed it, for I by looſing my life, do accompliſh what I am bound to.</p>
               <p>With theſe animating reaſons they arriued to the doore where the Ladie expected them, with ſo great feare ſeeing they ſtaied ſo long, that ſhe was a thouſand times about to go away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:16"/>The two haughtie warriours alighted, and the Prince giuing his watchword, the ioyfull Lady opened the doore and ſaid: I promiſe you diſpairing knight, you behaue your ſelfe ſo like an ill priſoner, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time there wil be no licenſe to walke foorth, hauing made this ſo long.</p>
               <p>He replied, I am ſo pleaſant (excellent Princeſſe) with this impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that I wold ere I returned bring company with me, that the might participate of the ioy here enioyed. A greater offence then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, deſerueth pardon with ſo good excuſe. Conditionally (anſwered ſhe) that I know who he is, for ſéeing with what courage he helped the Greeke Prince, makes me ſuſpect he is of that happie Countrey. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> replied. So great is the deſire I haue towards your ſeruice (ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne <hi>Venus,</hi>) that it was able to bring in my aide, and your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice no leſſe then my deare Lord and Vnckle <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> Prince of <hi>Dacia.</hi> Who had alreadie put off his Helme, diſcouering his excellent complexion, intreating the kiſſing of her white hand. He that hath them ſo good (ſaid ſhe) is wronged, in not commaunding that honor of all the Orbe. Now may I liue content, knowing that the protectors of all neceſſities abides in my Court: And ſince in handling my affaires, you make me your euerlaſting friend, I know not why I ſhould not openly reueale my ſecrets to you, though to my coſt, for it wil not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content him who hath placed all felicitie ſo faithfully to loue. And to this end, it wil be good the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> ſhould goe to the ſuſpitious knights lodging, that he may at large know, what hereaway hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. To morrow I wil ſend him one of my Damzels, to ſhewe it him. For it behoues the Gréeke Prince to returne to priſon, leaſt he be miſt.</p>
               <p>Whereto the <hi>Dacian</hi> anſwered. With whatſoeuer your ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne bewtie ſhall commaund, will I reſt moſt contented. For here now we only wil procure yours, although therein I hazard my life. I hoped no leſſe of ſuch a knight (ſaid ſhe) for ſuch as you in defending I receiue no wrong, ought to ſhewe they be knights. And hereupon they departed, appointing that with his Page and Dwarffe, he ſhould go to the groue of Louers, whither they would aduiſe him by <hi>Fauſta</hi> the next day what ſhall be done, and ſurely making the doore faſt, ſhe tooke the Gréeke Prince by the hand, ſaying.</p>
               <p>I am ſorie renowned Prince to haue put you in ſo many daungers
<pb facs="tcp:13978:16"/>
in my behalfe. but I truſt in the diuine powers, I ſhall one day ſhewe my ſelfe not vngratefull: he anſwered. Small is not the wrong I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by thoſe words, your ſoueraigne beautie being aſſured that if I haue, or ſhall haue any content, it is onely to procure yours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue me, of little deſert is the hazard of my life in ſo neceſſarie daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſo much the more, knowing that in <hi>Venus</hi> ſeruice, any perill is a paſtime.</p>
               <p>Ile ſuffer my ſelf to be flattered herein (ſaid ſhe) &amp; that my beautie hath obtained ſo good credit. And becauſe I thinke it is reaſon you returne to the Tower, heere put off your armour, for theſe will I kéepe with me, to put me in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance how much I am indebted to their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. With ſuch grace ſhe diſarmed him, that ſhe diſgraced <hi>Cynthia</hi> in her pride, though then ſhe ſéemed more faire, then when ſhee viſited <hi>Endymion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee tooke his leaue of the Ladie, and going through the Caue, they mounted the ſtaires, where in his chamber hee found his truſtie <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſandro,</hi> with the diſcréet <hi>Fauſta;</hi> that expected him with ſome feare of his long tarrying, although they had not gréeued had he a little longer ſtayed, for the damzels wittie chat had attracted the Pages affection, and were they wiſe, they had not deferde the execution of their deſires, ſince ſo good opportunitie the Gréeke had giuen them with his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galtenor</hi> doth not expreſſe it onely, ſaith: that when the Prince of <hi>Croacia</hi> went to ayde <hi>Greece,</hi> and carried <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Fauſta</hi> with him, that ſhe ſéeing <hi>Poliſandro</hi> there knighted, was contented to bee made a Ladie, a manifeſt token for any ſuſpected minde to thinke they had contracted it. From thence went the damzell accompanied with <hi>Poliſandro</hi> to <hi>Venus</hi> chamber, and returned to the Prince, cloſed the Caue after him, of whom he vnderſtood the <hi>Dacian</hi> was the knight that helpt him.</p>
               <p>Who being out of the garden, mounted on his ſwift <hi>Tirio,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the Forreſt he was appoynted, whither he was directed (as one that well knew it) by the dwarffe, that with him and his Page in pleaſant chat paſt away moſt part of the night, glad to haue occaſion wherein he might helpe his couſin. So the time to take ſome reſt being come, he ſtept aſide from them, and lying along the gréen graſſe with his head on his helme, he ſlept the greateſt part of the night, and
<pb facs="tcp:13978:17"/>
taking his ſhield, ſtraight went towards that place, and comming to a ſpacious plaine, at the farther end thereof, he could diſcerne ſome ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards that attended their flockes. They were talking of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth affaires, entermingling them with matters of Loue. The haughtie <hi>Dacian</hi> arriued, and aſſuring them from the feare they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by his comming, ſaid. Feare not gentle ſhepheards, for my comming is not to diſcontent you, ſaue onely throughly to heare your diſcourſes of amorous cares.</p>
               <p>One of them that ſéemed to commaund the reſt, aunſwered. Wee very much eſtéeme (ſir Knight) of the good opinion you haue of the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clauonian</hi> ſhepheards, and beléeue me, there is no reaſon to conceiue the contrarie, eſpecially of thoſe that féede their flockes in the groue of Louers, for here with moſt efficacie doth Loue manifeſt his power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, becauſe true loue ſhould neuer bee wanting, from among theſe ſpreading mirtles, on whoſe leaues and growing barkes, is the life of thoſe Louers written, to incourage him that languiſheth, ſéeing what they ſuffered, whoſe deathes with their names, named this Groue.</p>
               <p>Great occaſion gallant ſhepheards, hath the hearing of this Groue béene (replied the <hi>Dacian</hi>) to bring me hither from my farre remoted countrie, to knowe the aduenture thereof. The ſhepheards did reſt affected to him, ſéeing his behauiour: and ſome more preciſely noting him, (hauing that day béene in the Cittie) knew him to bee one of the Knights that had with ſuch honour ended the battell, ſo made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. To no place (ſir knight) could you haue come, to haue more truer information of the thing you deſire, then this, for beeing ſo long ſince we haue kept our flockes heerein, we haue learned of our elders why this valley is called of the Louers. Whereto the <hi>Dacian</hi> ſaide: Why then ſhould I impute it a fauor (if it bee no trouble) to relate it me, wherein you ſhall perpetually binde me? In much more then this (replied the diſcréet ſhepheard) deſire we to content yon, for your déeds this day done in <hi>Alantho,</hi> deſerue farre much more. So ſat he downe among them, where the ſhepheard began his ſtorie in this manner. When here arriued the Author and builder of this great Cittie, and firſt King of this countrie, there inhabited on the higheſt toppe of this mountaine, a people whoſe quiet and pleaſing dwelling through their excellent gouernment and care, brought it to bee the gallanteſt &amp; moſt pleaſanteſt Town in althis kingdom. Lord of this ſoyle was a knight,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:17"/>
                  <hi>Celio</hi> by name, the valianteſt and of rareſt conſtitution, then knowne in all the vniuerſe, inſomuch that he was called the Oracle of his age. He had two brothers, the ſecond named <hi>Alcyno,</hi> and the third <hi>Larſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> they had a ſiſter yonger then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but elder in beautie, which was ſuch, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many places ſtrangers came only to ſée her perfeéei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on whom ſome loſt their liues at the very firſt ſight. This Ladie called <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> their Parents did conſecrate to this Groue, dedicated to <hi>Diana,</hi> to adminiſter to her rites in companie of her other voweſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they brought her there ſo young, and ſhe ſo much delighted in that ſolitude, giuing her ſelfe ſolely to hunt, that ſhee became ſo excéedingly obliuious of her Parents and kindred, that ſhe procured by all meanes poſſible to occult her ſelfe from them, and all humane creatures: it was eaſie to be done by reaſon of the thickneſſe and intricate paſſages of the ſame, which was no little ioy to her, thinking ſhe liued neuer more to be ſéene of any. This life did ſhe lead till the age of fouretéene yeares: for then did her beautie ſtaine the ſunnes in his mid-daies pride, whoſe fame the other Nimphes of the Temple publiſhed abroad throughout the ſpacious world. One day among the reſt, as Prince <hi>Celio</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to recreate himſelf, deſcending this way on hunting, he chanſed to finde her neare a cleare fountaine that lies behinde this little hill, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Vnfortunate, by reaſon of that which happened thereat. Where <hi>Celio</hi> ſéeing her, and of ſuch admirable beautie, blame him not if hée yéelded a thouſand ſoules, (ſo many if he had) for much more deſerued her excellencies and moſt gracious brauerie. Hee went towards her, ſhewing by his alteration what he went for, and how eſtranged from himſelfe he ſhould depart, at the drawing of his attracted eies from her ſight. From her being, roſe the ſolitarie Goddeſſe diſcontented, to haue met with that knight, who ſéeing her, diſdaining coyneſſe, followed to ouertake her, ſtayning her with ſighes that procéeded from the middeſt of his perplexed heart: but the frée Ladie careleſſe of his cares, declared hers, in onely haſting her ſwift running ſteppes, turning her face, from whom acknowledged her for his Goddeſſe. Shee could not ſo far outrunne him, but he at laſt ouertooke her, and catching holde by her thin ſléeue, falling on his knées, began thus. Oh ſacred Ladie, why ſhould you ſhew ſuch crueltie againſt him that muſt liue onely to loue you, hoping for no longer life then you ſhal grant, admitting his deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? but oh, if you ſhall ioy to proſecute your ſtrangeneſſe, let mee not prorogue your vengeance on my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:18"/>While this dagger is readie to execute your ſharpe decree, for ſo you do remaine without diſpleaſure, it will be my pleaſure to ſatiſfie your doome with my death.</p>
               <p>The crueltie (ſir knight) you ſpeake of, ſhould I vſe towards my ſelfe? (replied the diſdainfull <hi>Laiſſa</hi>) ſhould I regard your prayers, knowing how Capitall the offence is againſt the chaſte <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe Nimphes (of whom I being one) are firſt afore all other things ſworn to the puritie of a ſingle life? and ſo my ſelfe ioying in the ſwéetneſſe of ſo choiſe a liuing as that led in ſolitude, ſhould not then cruelly tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize ouer my coontent, procuring your eaſe, to looſe my libertie? With many currents of pearled teares diſtilling from his eyes, the amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Celio</hi> anſwered.</p>
               <p>Neuer (ſacred Goddeſſe) did my imagination ſo much as thinke by louing to worke my content, in any thing to abridge yours: onely I beſéech (and this is not to offend you) that though my merits deſerue not your ſight, nor my ſelfe be woorthie to adore you, I may to nouriſh my elſe dying life, make you ſolely to my ſelfe, the ſole commandreſſe of my oppreſſed ſoule, and that I may repaire to your glorious name, with the tributarie duties of my poore hearts ſpoyles. Somewhat mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grewe the ſiſter of amorous <hi>Celio,</hi> for there is no Ladie ſo cruell and vnthankefull, but reioyces to be beloued, for ſuch vertue doth loue ſet in the Ladie loued, that onely to deſerue the gift to be beloued, ſhée will loue.</p>
               <p>She would haue anſwered, but the comming of <hi>Alcyno</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond brother interrupted her, who almoſt before hee ſawe her, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his ſoule vnto her, as a pledge of his true loue. The like ſacrifice did the third make of hs, that then arriued, which two laſt ſéeing their brother, and with that Ladie, ere they knewe how to loue, expreſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued tokens to be iealous. To breake their ſilence, the third brother ſaid. What good fortune is this, (good brother) to méete with ſo gallant a Ladie in ſo ſolitarie a place? So haue the heauens appointed it my deare brother (replied <hi>Celio.</hi>) And being nothing iealous of them, to feare to ſay his minde, added: that the power of my thoughts béeing imployed on her, my ſoule may triumph in content to haue found ſuch a Soueraigne. Moſt woorthie is her beautie (ſaide the ſecond) of the offer of my noble thought, whoſe reliques may ſolemnize her braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: neither is vnoccupied, for Loue doth occupie them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:18"/>And whileſt <hi>Alcino</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Larſinio</hi> gluts himſelfe with gazing. And if by chance all thrée be ſilent, ſhe by mouing the Organs of her ſpéech, kindles the fire that vnconſumingly doth burne them. <hi>Celio</hi> loues, and the mollified Lady looking on him, by the motions of her eye-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplending ſunnes, with infinit ſignes of hopes, doth incourage him to perſiſt in his moued ſute: and for his ſake, ſhée affects the other two, knowing they were his brethren. She expreſt it by her kind words, in anſwering them.</p>
               <p>Such is the condition of loue (moſt bewteous Ladies, credit me, it is knowne by experience) that any amorous motion how fained ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, is accepted of the Louer, as a manifeſt token, that onely he, is he, ſoly beloued.</p>
               <p>In like maner fell it out with the brothers. For as the Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtraungeneſſe kindly ſpake to them, the more to winne <hi>Celio</hi> to her ſelfe, either of the others accounted themſelues to be eſpecially beloued. The greateſt part of the day continued they in pleaſing that, intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelues in the ſnares of that deceiuing net, that there with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand childiſh toyes did leape from bowe to bowe to inſnare theſe poore Louers in their owne vnhappie conceits, vntil the withdrawing time of the recluſe Goddeſſe called her away, which forced the thrée brothers to returne vnto their home, purpoſing euery day to come thither, in queſt of whom they loued, yet minding to take their ſeuerall way. For nothing was ſufficient to diſſwade the two brothers that they were not beloued, to deſiſt the proſecuting of their intented loues. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after they ſpake with the Lady, not knowing nor remembring ſhe was their ſiſter: but ſhe by all exterior meanes, told the two youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhe could admit none ſaue the elder. Neuertheleſſe, ſo poſſeſt was loue of the two brothers ſoules, that in ſuch ſort it blinded them, that they would neuer beléeue it was as ſhe ſaid, and their owne eyes ſawe to be moſt true: for the perfect ſincere loue which nouriſh them, cauſed them to deuiſe the expedients meanes to end their paſſionated labors. They found it, and to their liues coſt: for paſſing ſome moneths in this entertainment, one day, diſmall and blacke to this Countrey (ſince ſo much calamitie fel on it) <hi>Larſinio</hi> the yonger brother haſtened his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſéeke his ſiſter, clad all in rich ſhining armor. He met with her at the vnhappie Fountaine (through their luckleſſe euents ſo called) in whoſe bubbling Current ſhée was waſhing her faire white Alabaſter

hands. His Beuer lifted vp the Louer, and nimbly leaping from his horſe, went ſtraight towards the Founte. To receiue him ranue the Ladie, guerdoning his comming with a louing imbrace, not as to her brother or Louer, but ſo neare in ally to him whom with heart ſhe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, which the Prince attributed not to <hi>Celio</hi> in fauour, nor his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinitie to <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> ſaue to his owne pure loue, which was ſo great, that he iudged himſelfe in reſpect of deſeruer of that courteſie.</p>
               <p>But Fortune now alreadie wearie, and angrie the earth ſhould longer containe them, ordained <hi>Alcino</hi> ſhould ſée the imbracement, who not knowing his brother by reaſon he was armed, ſet ſpurres to his horſe being alſo in armes. The Louer cloſed his Vizor ſéeing the other come in that manner, and mounting on his horſe, ſtept to him, ſaying. What ſéeke you in ſuch haſte ſir knight?</p>
               <p>Onely (replied the ſecond brother) to let you know the little reaſon you had to offer violence vnto that Ladie.</p>
               <p>Inraged, as well indéed he might, became the vnwary youth, and not ſuppoſing he was his brother, turned about his Courſer, and ſaide. Why then ſtaie bolde knight, for this ſhall chaſtiſe thy rude raſhe intention. <hi>Alcino</hi> cowched his Launce, making their incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with as much noyſe, as if two ſhippes had met. Of mightie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were the youthes, and ſo they proſecuted their battle with as much ſtrength as crueltie, that the Ladie which beheld them, could not but pittie the blowes which <hi>Larſinio</hi> receiued with ſome teares: for the loue ſhe bore his brother, forced her to ſhead them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond brother cloſed with <hi>Larſinio,</hi> ſtriking away at one ſtroke the halfe of his ſhield, wounding him ſorely on the arme, which was occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they caſt eithers armes about the other, with ſuch power, that both fell from their Saddles to the ground. Striuing, vp and downe they tumbled on the graſſe, beſpringling the earth with their blood.</p>
               <p>When the haughtie <hi>Celio</hi> arriued, who ſéeing the battle, not perceiuing the Ladie there, lept from his horſe, and drawing forth his ſword, went towards them and ſaid. In courteſie ſir knights, ceaſe a while your fights, which cauſeleſſe ſéemes to be ſo fierce. Either was ſo fleſht againſt the other, thinking the Lady offended by eithers acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that vnwilling to obey their elder brother, (that being alſo in rich abillements of warre was not knowne) <hi>Alcino</hi> made reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:19"/>Doo not you ſir knight ſéeke to part our Combat, whoſe cauſe we haue adiudged too ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding (ſaid <hi>Celio</hi>) for my ſake and intreatie, I hope you will leaue it. It will be then (anſwered the youngeſt) to make you confeſſe you are diſcourteous, in wiſhing peace where none is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. And ſo he being got betwéene them, and they both angred togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they diſcharged two ſuch blowes vpon him, that he repented to haue vndertaken that demaund: but being of incomparable ſtrength, quickly ſetled himſelfe among them, beginning one of the fierceſt fights in the world. Aboue two houres they continued hacking, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pittie cruelly cutting their armes and fleſhe, that euery one had aboue eight wounds.</p>
               <p>The Ladie feared ſome vnhappie chaunce, whoſe heart was ſo deliberated with feare to ſée <hi>Larſinio</hi> ſo wounded (for the others ſhée knew not) that ſhe could not riſe, nor with her voyce giue notice ſhée was there: ſo we gaue occaſion vnto the lamentableſt and moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie act that euer was acted. For <hi>Celio</hi> weary of ſo long delay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelfe of the ſecond brother, with a cruell thruſt to his thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bereaft poore <hi>Larſinio</hi> of his life, whoſe death ſo extreamly grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Alcino,</hi> (as if he had knowne him) that diſpairing of life, did caſt his ſhield to the ground, and cloſed with his brother, who doing the like, ſo long wraſled, that both fell to the earth, where drawing foorth their daggers, with equall blowes either ſtabbed in the others bodie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither at once, looſing their vitall breathing, to the Ladies ſo great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that ſhe thought to burſt.</p>
               <p>She roſe, bewayling that accurſed happe, and went to <hi>Larſinio,</hi> tooke off his Helme, and ſéeing him like one dead, ſhe became more then dead. Néedes would ſhée know the others, which was cauſe of greater euil, for their Helmes being off and knowne who they were, a thouſande lamentations did ſhée breathe into the aire, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her miſfortune.</p>
               <p>Shée fell in a traunce, and twiſe or thriſe loſt the motion of her mouing powers, and at length recouering her ſelfe, and ſeeing the thrée Princes, for her ſake with ſuch remorſeleſſe ſauadgeneſſe ſlaine, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the golden tramels of her amber haire, whoſe bewtie eclipſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi> light, thus ſhe began her lament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:20"/>Oh cruel heauens, wherein haue I deſerued this mortal plague? Or how haue I offended, you ſhould ſo much maligne my hopes, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your happie influences with ſuch dire euent, againſt the ſpringing of my ioyes? Had you ſuffered me to kéepe my life within the limits of my ſolitary walks, theſe Princes had not ſéene me, and ſo not viewing my ill beſtowed bewtie, they had not deſired what ſoly was due to one. Oh deare Princes, you ſhould haue bene contented to ſee your brother beloued, and your ſelues for his ſake affected, to deſiſt the procurement of your pleaſure, with his, and your owne deaths. Oh chaſte Goddeſſe, why didſt thou ſuffer ſo execrable a fact, hatefull, abhorred and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were my life vnto the world, ſhould I deſire to liue, that ſawe the timeleſſe end of your vnripe yeares. For this, oh this vaine momentary fading bewtie! How, oh how may ſhe (valiant Princes) recompence this déed, this deare and amorous déed, but to immitate you in death, that did Idolatrize me in life? Reaſon had <hi>Tysbe</hi> to ſuffer for her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and <hi>Hero,</hi> rather to taſte of the bitter waters of death, then of the actiue fire of loue, that in her entrailes burned. None had ſuch reaſon to die as I: and in ſpeaking it, to prolong my deſpiſed life, I doo offend: which though I might, I will not enioy, in abſence of thoſe thrée that did ſo dearly loue me.

Wherevpon with mortall fury ſhe drew <hi>Celios</hi> ſword, and ſetting her breſt to the ſharpe point, ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her life to deaths tryumphing ſpoiles. Which no ſooner was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but the blew heauens with thicke fogs and myſts was clowded, with thundring and lightning, and innumerable horrible voyces, that ſtrooke deadly terror in the harmeleſſe people, who with their flockes and heards of cattle, periſhed. Their bodies were neuer found, nor if is not knowne what is become of them, more then that their liues and deaths, with the maner and occaſion, was found carued in carrecters vpon ſome Okes there adioyning, where ſome ſhepheards haue often ſéene a Caue, from whence iſſues ſuch flames and ſmoake, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Trées neare to it, and it is many yeares, ſince none dares through feare let their flocks féed thereabouts.</p>

               <p>The ſhepheards ſhewed it him more to content him, then to thinke he would aduenture to deſcend thither.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith <hi>Brutus</hi> ſword in hand, and his new inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhield, with maieſtick ſteps marching towards the timorous caue, (moſt kind Ladie) left we the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, with whom neither the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Pages nor ſhepheardes, preuailed to giue ouer his commenced enterpriſe: neither the neceſſitie wherein he knew he had left his deare Coſin <hi>Claridiano,</hi> &amp; the beautious <hi>Venus,</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Croacia,</hi> for his deſire to knowe what that feareful caue contained, made him diſpence with all theſe, and drowne the memorie of his owne affaires in the center of obliuion.</p>
               <p>So with <hi>Herculian</hi> courage committing his ſafetie to the powers diuine, he beganne to enter the terror-bréeding Caue, that rather ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an infernall deſcent vnto the helliſh vawtes, ſo much, and ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was the fire that thither welcommed him: from vtter burning by
<pb facs="tcp:13978:21"/>
thoſe conſuming flames did diſpairing <hi>Brutus</hi> inchaunted armor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him: yet neuertheleſſe felt he the greateſt paine in all his life: for beſides innumerable number of horrible voyces that ſounded within that hollowneſſe, many thouſand hideous deformed ſhapes and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions oppoſed themſelues againſt him, with ſtéeled maſes hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on his bodie, with ſuch ſeleritie, that ſometimes his handes, then his knées, and ſometimes both, he was forced to ſit on the ground: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that his own blows wherwith he ſtrook the emptie aire, ſerued to no other purpoſe, but with the fruitleſſe exerciſe to wearie his arme, that he could not féele it.</p>
               <p>In this vneuen warre labored he about an houre, minding many times to returne backe, ſo erterne hot was the fier, but ſurpriſed with conſideration of whom hee was, and what ignominious infamie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waighted ſuch an act, with much ſtriuing hee obtained the ende of the burning Caue, where he met with a great Piller, which nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him, that by getting behinde it, might defend him from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers. But here was he in the greateſt daunger of all his life time, for the Piller he imbraced, became a moſt fearefull Gyant, who ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt him, that he thruſt his armor within his fleſh, and the flames being no leſſe, that from him procéeded, then thoſe he indured thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Hee ſtrongly ſtayed himſelfe, remembring whom hee had to doo with, and caſting his mightie armes about him, turned him vp and downe as if hee had béene ſome common Knight, till angered that ſo long that wraſts had laſted, hee hoyſed him from the ground, and with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength ranne him againſt the wall, that terminated the Caue. Scarce had he done it, when vaniſhing, in his place he loft a doore, through which with vncontrowled minde he entred, comming into a freſh delightſome gréene, with ſuch different varietie of trées in ſuch artificiall order ſet, that the ſight eaſed him of his paſt toyle. At one end thereof he ſawe a ſumptuous building, ſéeming not by humane hands erected, for the top raiſed like to a <hi>Pyramide,</hi> ſéemed to checke the clowdes in height, and as the ſame reuerberated on the glittering ſtones, the great ſplendor thereof dazeled the beholders eyes. At the entrance thereof ſtood thrée pines, to ſupport ſo many Arches, vnder which lay three Knights, which ſéemed to defend the entrie. The one and biggeſt in conſtitution of bodie, was cladde in Indian colour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:21"/>
with many Lillies grauen there vpon. And on his ſhielde, that hung at the trée, was figured the portrature of Faith, with this word.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>On earth if any honour bee,</l>
                  <l>All tride honour comes by mee.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The other two were alike in ſkie colour armes, full of ſtrawberies, and on their ſhields Enuie pictured with many eyes, as the <hi>Aſſirians</hi> vſed to paint her, the inſcription thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Enuies ſeruants thouſands are,</l>
                  <l>All which miſchiefes do deuiſe:</l>
                  <l>Then to looke on each ones care,</l>
                  <l>Enuie muſt haue many eyes.</l>
               </q>
               <p>All thrée ſhewed themſelues to be of valour, which made the <hi>Daci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Lord imagine (as indéed they were). <hi>Laiſſas</hi> brothers. Before the Arches there was made a horſe race, at the beginning whereof, hung a Table with theſe words, whoſe meaning <hi>Don Eleno</hi> read thus.</p>
               <q>In the time to come, when the moſt happieſt in Loue, and with whom Fortune hath ſhewed her ſelfe moſt fauourable, ſhall here arriue, then this aduenture of the Louers ſhall haue ende: and alſo the torments that <hi>Laiſſa</hi> ſuffers: for ſo hath <hi>Nycoſiano</hi> the great Magician of the Greene valley ordered.</q>
               <p>Plainly did the <hi>Dacian</hi> perceiue, that the Table ſpake by him, ſince through ſo many miſfortunes he had arriued to ſo happie a Hauen, as the inioying of his beautious <hi>Roſamonde.</hi> With gallant Maieſtie he entred the race, being confronted by the younger of the thrée brothers. The reſt ſéeing the warre offered them, mounted on their Courſers preparing for it, as they which had no more iudgement, but for that, Iudge of the battell néeds would <hi>Cupid</hi> be, the mightie K. of <hi>Sowles</hi> and <hi>Hartes,</hi> ſitting in all royaltie on a Imperiall throne, for worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip ſtupendious, ſhewing himſelfe (his eyes not blinded) with irefull aſpect. At his féet lay proſtrated all thoſe that had rebelled againſt his decrée.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:22"/>But they which had maintained his ſtatutes, and obſerued his laws, and with vaine Idolatrie adored his rights, ſate round about in royall chaires, euerie one in his degrée, according to the ſupremacie of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: and with moſt care of obedience acknowledging his feoltie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to him with the due tribute of his ſoule, as to their true ſworne Prince.</p>
               <p>The ſignall of the fight was giuen with ſo many thouſandes of militarie inſtruments, as if heauen and earth ſhould méete. Whereat ſwifter then an ayrie thought, the warrelike warriour prickt againſt <hi>Larſinio,</hi> incountring him with ſuch ſtrength, that he forced him looſe his ſtirropes and bridle, &amp; had almoſt ouerthrown him from his ſaddle. With braue gallantneſſe paſt the <hi>Dacian</hi> forwards, turning vpon his aduerſarie with his naked ſword in his hand, but ſcant had he done ſo, when quicker then the winde, the ſecond brother ſpurde againſt him, running at his backe with ſuch force, that had he not held by his horſe necke, he had kiſt the ground.</p>
               <p>He had not done executing this blow, when like a thunderbolte the mightie <hi>Celio</hi> departed to him, méeting him (after the breaking of his launce) ſo forcibly with his horſes breaſt, that both tumbled to the ground. On his féete fell the <hi>Dacian,</hi> amazed at the knights deuiſe: who gaue him no longer time for this conſideration, for the two that on horſebacke remained, returned to ouerthrow him. Hee could not defend himſelf, for the courſe was ſhort, and ſo headlong they ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him. Ere he could riſe, <hi>Celio</hi> ſtept to him, with the greateſt blow he had in al his life receiued, for it had almoſt ſtrooke him ſenceleſſe, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all along vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>All this was no meanes to put the <hi>Dacian</hi> from his ſkilfull procéeding, for ere he could ſecond another, like a furious Lyon he roſe on his féet, reſolued to expect them. Hee ſawe himſelfe in daunger of death, for the two that remained on horſebacke, (with quicke and ſuddaine car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers) ſo oppreſt him, as he loſt his hope, with honour to iſſue out of that enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Among the horſes he ſetled himſelfe ſtrongly. A thing worthie his valour he did, for his ſhield forwards, he expected <hi>Larſinio,</hi> that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him had aduanced himſelfe, but no more he mooued him, then if he had runne againſt a rock, whom with his horſe ſtaggering back, the <hi>Dacian</hi> forced to fall, whereat the Prince was glad, knowing
<pb facs="tcp:13978:22"/>
that on foote he could better deale with them. So he ſtept aſide, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Alcino</hi> paſſe, and as he went, gaue him ſuch a thruſt, which was it that aſſured him the victorie, making him therewith, maugre his ſtrength, to leaue his ſaddle. For all this he had no cauſe to boaſt of the blowe: for the inraged <hi>Celio</hi> ranne to him with both hands laying on his rich helme, the temper gaue him his life, elſe had his head downe to his necke béene diuided, yet made he the blood in great abundance guſh through his noſe.</p>
               <p>By this were the other two vp with their ſwords in hand. It was a combat moſt worthie <hi>Cupids</hi> ſight, for the thrée are mightie, and the <hi>Dacian</hi> the ſame he was woont, and a foote ſtronger then <hi>Mars,</hi> hée ſhewed himſelfe like a cunning fencer, ſetting forth at length his ſhield and ſword, to intice them to make offer. Herein hee preuailed, for moſt blowes he receiued on his ſhield, which being inpenetrable, they did not ſo much as race it.</p>
               <p>In this manner a while he behaued himſelfe, but hee iudged it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe ſo to end the battell: wherefore brauely he ruſht among them, well couering himſelfe with his ſhield, and as hee paſt, he gaue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond brother ſuch a counterbuffe on the helme, ſtriking away a great part of his vizor that it was aduenture he had not done ſo by his head.</p>
               <p>Downe along the breaſt deſcended the ſword, making there a long daungerous wound, with another he would haue ended that battell, had the other two let him. But the haughtie <hi>Celio</hi> with impoyſoned rage entred ſo much inwards, that at his pleaſure hee could diſcharge his furie on the toppe of the inchaunted ſhield, not able to cut it, yet ſo waightie was the blow, that thrée or foure ſteppes ſtaggering back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, it forced him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Larſinio</hi> was not ydle, for with a ſtrong point he thruſt at his breſt. He felt the blow, for it depriued him of his breaths paſſage. The two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not diſcharged their blowes, when the wounded <hi>Alcyno</hi> returned, and with both hands gaue him a moſt mightie ſtroke. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zound with Eccho did the gréene fields, by the warriors ſterne ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious blowes. And the angrie Iudge was aſtoniſhed to ſée with what crueltie they aſſayled each other.</p>
               <p>Aduantage had the warrelike <hi>Dacian</hi> in his armour, for though he was tired, yet they had no ſcarre. Otherwiſe was it with the brothers, for the fielde was beſprinkled with their blood. <hi>Don Elenos</hi> celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:13978:23"/>
much auailed him, elſe he had not got the victorie ſo cheape, but it and the ſureneſſe of his armes, makes it certaine. Thrée houres haue they fought, making no ſhewe of fainting, in the end of which, was the <hi>Dacian</hi> alreadie at the extreameſt of his rage, thinking he had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt of the fight, ſo caſting his ſhield at his backe, and with his ſword twixt both hands, began to brandiſh it among them, quicker then the <hi>Cyclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Smithes doo their crooked hammers, and as he could not miſſe them, he gaue no blowe but fetcht blood. In the ſelfe ſame Coyne doo they paie him: for the thrée more fiercer then <hi>Alcydes,</hi> aſſayled him ſo brauely, that if he giues, he receiues, and in greater quantitie, with equall quallitie. Now ſkill and dexteritie preuailes not with him, all he remits to blowes, wherewith he rents, cuts, and in péeces ſhiuers their armor, priuy coates and ſhields.</p>
               <p>He would firſt diſpatch <hi>Celio</hi> which moſt troubled him, ſo get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the two, entered to him, and in his aſſault, with a downright blowe he cut away his ſhield, with al his vanbrace, and a great péece of his ſhoulder. Scarce had he done it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a point he turned againſt the ſecond, thruſting thrée parts of his ſword vnder his arme pit, where had he put foorth his arme as he mought, for euer had he there laine.</p>
               <p>Vpon <hi>Larſinos</hi> waſte he diſcharged his furie ſo fiercely, that it was a wonder he had not in two diuided him. The heauens preſerued him to paie his iealouſie, although againſt the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince he loſt thereby. In his very ſoule was <hi>Celio</hi> vext, to ſée with what rygor that one knight handled them, that taking his ſword ſtrongly in his fiſt, aymed aloft, giuing <hi>Alcyno</hi> time to giue him a dangerous blow on the thigh: for falling betwéene a ioynt, it made him a wound outwards: ſo great was the paine, as he could not ſtand on that legge, which the brothers perceiuing, and aſſuring themſelues the victory, began to oppreſſe him ſo vehemently, as they depriued him of breathing. Eager herein ſéemed the third brother, and would make ſome ſhewe of his valour, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zulted to his deare coſt. For <hi>Don Eleno</hi> noting his intent, gaue back, as fearing the reſt, and ſo let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third enter: who being within his reach, with incredible force laide him on the head, he cut away moſt of his Helme, with a great péece of his head, tumbling him at his féete, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him thereto, with another no leſſe ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The other two cloſed with him, lamenting the ſucceſſe. He could not refuſe the wraſle. He entred thereto aduiſedly, firſt drawing foorth his
<pb facs="tcp:13978:23"/>
dagger, quickly they fell on the ground, where they tumbled a good while. It was aduantage for the <hi>Dacian</hi> to be ſo, for ſtretching foorth his arme in that place where before <hi>Alcyno</hi> was wounded on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> front, there againe <hi>Don Eleno</hi> ſtrooke him, making him looſe his hold, with the pangs of death. Then he turned on the firſt, whom for his valour he had affected, but at that inſtant forgetting it, let flie at his breſt a moſt cruell ſtabbe, wherewith he ended the braueſt aduenture euer in that kingdome knowne. The noyſe which the haughtie edefice made, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing away, was heard through all the Citie of <hi>Xantho.</hi> To <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> Throne was the Ladie conueyed, in that manner, as ſhe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her brothers deaths: whom the God of loue thanked for her amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, in giuing her ſelfe the mortall ſtroke of death, only mooued through zealous loue, for which hee promiſed her felicitie in her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>Againſt the two brothers that were cauſers of that vnhappy euent, was the ſentence read to this effect. To the purgatorie of Iealouſie and Enuie let them be carried, where they may purge the paine that their raſh vnaduiſed procéedings did put the famous <hi>Celio</hi> in. Whom the mightie Iudge commaunded to be ſent vnto the houſe of Hope, where he might liue in ioy, and ſure he ſhould obtaine a glorious and amorous ende, deſerued by his faith, and that the remembrance of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſiſter, ſhould not annoy him.</p>
               <p>This being done in preſence of the <hi>Dacian,</hi> who vnable to ſtirre, with many flaſhes of lightning, the heauens were ſomewhat darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, till all was paſt, he founde himſelfe in the open field, hard by the bewteous <hi>Layſſa,</hi> and before them a Piller of fire, with theſe words which <hi>Don Eleno</hi> did read in this maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Purgatory of Enuiers ſhall here remaine, iuſtly puniſhing the two Louers: til the ſonne of the cruell Lyoneſſe ſhall giue them libertie: Diſcouering alſo the Caſtle of Hope: whoſe wonders ſhall not be by any ſeene, till the foure moſt fierceſt Lyoneſſes ſhal meet at this Fount.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:24"/>So greatly deſired the Prince to ſee the ſcrole, that hee ſawe not the Ladie, till turning about, hee ſpyed her come towardes him a pace, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie aſſured of the true manner of this ſucceſſe, and how ſhe was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the dead: yet knowing they remained but inchaunted, ioyfully going neare him, ſaid. I knowe not (moſt ſoueraigne knight) how I may ſatiſfie the dutie you haue bound me too, in hazarding your life for me in ſo manifeſt a perill: although ſo braue a déed as this, brings with it his due recompence.</p>
               <p>It is ſufficient (excellent Ladie) anſwered the Prince, that it bée knowne, I did you therein ſome ſeruice, which bound all the world (ſeeing what wrong you indured, being kept heere) to procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. The comming of the ſhepheards, Squire and Dwarffe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted their farther ſpéech. Euerie one did their dutie to the Prince and Ladie. Whom <hi>Don Eleno</hi> receiued, as if he had not in a long time ſeene them.</p>
               <p>At this time entred the ſame an infinit number of knights, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the king and the Prince <hi>Lindauro,</hi> that galloped amaine to know the newes. The ſhepheards aduanced themſelues, for reward of the newes, ſaying: that the ruſſet knight which had ended the battel in the Cittie, had terminated the Louers-aduenture. It greatly glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euery one for <hi>Laiſſas</hi> diſinchauntment: though being done by <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> it nothing pleaſed the king, that in his heart did hate him. By this approached the <hi>Dacian</hi> on his mightie <hi>Tyrio,</hi> bringing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy behinde him, ſo faire, that ſhe affected euery one, and had not <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauro</hi> borne ſo great good will towards <hi>Venus,</hi> doubtleſſe he had elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her his Goddeſſe.</p>
               <p>The King entertained him with better exterior ſhewe, then inward minde, thanking him for the good he had done in his kingdome. The <hi>Dacian</hi> would not (after hee had replyed with his becomming dutie) treat of any thing touching the priſoners liberties, but rather deuiſed other matter of diſcourſe, till they all fixed their eyes on a gallant Knight, that deſcended downe the valley ſo well armed, that it deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery one. None there but gazed on him, and the Ladie with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more earneſtneſſe: and with affection beganne to commend his brauerie. He was mounted on a mightie Rone Courſer, his armor of a Tawnie, garniſhed with many gréene flowers, which brauely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him. His ſhield about his arme, in middeſt whereof was a
<pb facs="tcp:13978:24"/>
knight lying along, laying foorth his breaſts to <hi>Cupid,</hi> that with a dart angerly ſéemed to threaten him with this Motto.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Strike home, the Gods will ſure his woorth commend,</l>
                  <l>Who ſpoyles a wretch, that wants meanes to defend.</l>
               </q>
               <p>His launce he carried in his hand, and with ſuch heroicke grace, that excepting the knights which ended the battell, they had not ſéene any of better diſpoſition. Approaching and doing his dutie to the king, he ſtraight knew <hi>Don Eleno</hi> by his deuiſe, which not a little pleaſed him to méete him in thoſe partes, for he himſelf was the mightie <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiano,</hi> Prince of <hi>Babilon, Florions</hi> Nephew, and ſonne to <hi>Brandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel,</hi> and hee that in <hi>Grecia</hi> was choſen for the third chalenger of the Imperiall Iouſts, and going with his father to <hi>Babilon,</hi> was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him by a tempeſt. The youth was not in loue, but came in the laſt condition of béeing, for turning about and looking on that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in recompence of his ſight, hee gaue her both heart and ſoule, and yet complained of himſelfe to haue giuen her no more, iudging her beautie to deſerue farre more.</p>
               <p>The king demaunded who he was, ioying that ſuch a knight ſhould arriue at his Court. But he excuſed himſelfe the beſt hee could, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that his diſcouerie might diſpleaſe the <hi>Dacian.</hi> The king would not ſéeme to importune him ouer much therein, ſo turning about, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all his traine to the Cittie. It was alreadie knowne in euerie place what had happened, &amp; <hi>Venus</hi> had aduertiſed the <hi>Greeke</hi> thereof, who was excéeding glad of his Vncles aduenture. All the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularitie entertained the <hi>Dacian</hi> with loude ſalutations of immortall praiſes, ſaying: Long liue the knight that hath ſo honoured our land. It ſo vext <hi>Lindauro,</hi> that a thouſand times he was about to command them to ſilence, but he diſſembled it to conceale his euill intent. So neare went the new <hi>Perſian</hi> Louer to <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> that all full of affection, he tooke occaſion to ſpeake thus. With reaſon may your ſoueraigne beautie complaine of all knights, for being ſo remiſſe in procuring your libertie, that they might looſe theirs. The Ladie well vnderſtood him, for ſhee was ſkilfull in the Art of Loue, and now againe beginning therein, plainly coniectured the end, ſo replying to the purpoſe, ſaide. Of my ſelfe may I moſt lament (ſir knight) to be borne with ſuch lacke
<pb facs="tcp:13978:25"/>
of fortune, that I rather attribute my long impriſonment to it, then to the fault of ſtraunger knight, for being ended by this knight, that was the firſt which prooued it, it might haue happened ſo to any other, wherefore I am ſolely gréeued with mine owne miſfortune: and ſorry would I be, that my libertie ſhould cauſe ſuch loſſe as you ſpeake of, for I would haue none complaine of wrong by me. They arriued at the Pallace, where the beautious <hi>Laiſſa</hi> lighted in the armes of the Prince of <hi>Babylon,</hi> being led by the aydes of <hi>Don Eleno</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiniano,</hi> which content not a little increaſed her beautie. More fairer then the ſunne in May <hi>Venus</hi> expected her comming. They embraced one another with that kindneſſe that befitted their eſtates, wherevpon the Princeſſe ſaid.</p>
               <p>I knowe not ſoueraigne Lady, to whom this Court ſhall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moſt bound vnto, whether to this knight, that with his valour hath ſo honoured it, liberating you from ſo iniuſt priſon, or to your excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that ſo hath beautified it. The <hi>Dacian</hi> replying ſaid. Moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Princeſſe, bee aſſured that whileſt you liue, there will want none that ſhall bee in your debt, leſſe then with his life, ſince you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to me, what onely is due with ſuch right to this Ladies beautie, in whoſe deliuerance the ending of this aduenture was nothing. Readie to burſt with anger ſtood <hi>Lindauro,</hi> ſéeing with what kindneſſe <hi>Venus</hi> ſpake to that knight, which made him ſuſpect his ending the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what he had done in the place, had mooued her to affection. He could no longer indure it, but called him, ſaying. Come (ſir Knight) and relate vnto the King what befell you with the Louers, for we ſhall all reioyce to heare it.</p>
               <p>From the Ladies he went, leauing the <hi>Perſian</hi> with them, betwéen whom they admitted him: for which place, <hi>Phoebus</hi> had exchanged his throne celeſtiall. <hi>Venus</hi> while <hi>Don Eleno</hi> diſcourſed with the kings, demaunded of him in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir knight, quietly and without grudge, if you will enioy ſo great a fauour as this, you muſt tell vs your name, raiſing your beauer, and this ſmall ſatiſfaction ſhall ſatiſfie ſo high a benefit? The <hi>Perſian</hi> replied. I had ere this done it (ſacred Princeſſe) without demaunde, but I feared to diſpleaſe thereby the knight in ruſſet: for although hée hath not knowne me, I could not haue met with better hap then him in this countrie, and if he bee here knowne, I will declare my name,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:25"/>
elſe I beſéech your excellencie, do not commaund it me. I onely am ſhe (of all this kingdome containes, ſaid <hi>Venus</hi>) that knowes him, and he not a little ioyed, diſcouered himſelfe to me: and ſo without feare may you tell me yours, for this Ladie and my ſelfe excepted, none ſhall euer knowe it.</p>
               <p>To ſatiſfie your content (excellent Ladie anſwered he) Ile no longer conceale it, I am <hi>Branſiniano,</hi> Prince of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> the greateſt friend the Gréekes haue, by reaſon my father was brought vp in company of the Emperour <hi>Alphebo,</hi> and I in <hi>Claridianos,</hi> in whoſe demaund I wander, &amp; as this knight is his ſo neare kinſman, I cannot but affect him: and had I not this reaſon, yet his valour bindes me to his loue: and raiſing his vizor, ſhewed his faire face, ſaying. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſhall be aſſured (diuine Ladies) how much I deſire your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, I haue diſcouered all that of my ſelfe I can.</p>
               <p>I do highly eſtéeme (braue Prince replied <hi>Venus</hi>) the account you haue giuen me of your ſtocke, and becauſe I will not long be your debtor for the ſame, I will giue you newes of that Gréeke you ſéeke, who in this Pallace is priſoner, vnknowne to any what he is, ſaue to the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> and me, who ſhall at large acquaint you with the cauſe, which is not lawfull any other ſhould know: and ſo I intreate your ſoueraigne beautie, my deare <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> to conceale it. So eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in contemplations of her new amorous thoghts, was the Lady, that neither it, nor what elſe was talked of, did ſhe marke, for of none did euer loue with more power take poſſeſſion, willingly making her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſéeing how great a Prince he was.</p>
               <p>She replied not to the purpoſe, ſaying. I greatly deſire (excellent Princeſſe) that ſince your knight hath recounted to them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, he doo it heere to vs. <hi>Venus</hi> knew not to what end ſhee ſo replied, but being wittie, quickly conceiued what might be the reaſon, ſo diſſembling it, ſaid. There is no reaſon but we ſhould bee ſatiſfied herein. So calling their Damzell <hi>Fauſta,</hi> ſent her in their behalfe to <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> But they could not end to giue her her charge, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſuddaine tumult that aroſe where the king was. The <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hearing it, ſtood vp, and cloſing his beuer, taking leaue of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, went towards the <hi>Dacian,</hi> at what time ſomewhat mooued, hee thus beganne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:26"/>Gladly (moſt mightie king of <hi>Eſclauonia</hi>) would I haue deferde vntill ſome other occaſion, what I will now ſay, becauſe I would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe this preſent ioy. But ſo great is the neceſſitie I haue to depart, that it forceth me to beſeech thee, in reſpect of the iuſtice thou haſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies maintained, thou wouldeſt be pleaſed to giue me the priſoners, whoſe libertie coſt me ſo much blood, and my companion much more, whoſe words haue not ſuffered him to come with me, although he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted me I ſhould on his behalfe, intreate ſo much of his Maieſtie, ſince as it ſéemed you reſted content, wee ſhould about their diſcharge vndertake the battell. Conſider it well, and anſwere me ſtraight, for I will immediately depart, publiſhing the iniuſtice I haue in thy Court receiued, through all the world. Here he ended, doing his dutie. Well (ſaid the king) he had reaſon, but he was ſo ſubborned by the Prince <hi>Lindauro,</hi> that to pleaſe him, he choſe rather to reiect it, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: I know (braue knight) you haue reaſon to demaunde theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, but ſéeing they ſlew ſuch great Princes, whoſe kindred crying out for iuſtice, forceth me to detaine them. To this ſaide <hi>Lindaura,</hi> your Maieſtie doth wrong your royall Crowne and ſeat, by ſo many waies, and in ſo many reſpects, to giue this knight ſo many ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of what with great right and iuſtice is done. Theſe words ſo inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Dacian,</hi> that hee was almoſt reſolued to ſtrike him, but hee ſtaied himſelfe, not willing to raiſe the whole Hall vppon him, ſo hée replied.</p>
               <p>It better would beſéem thée Prince of <hi>Siconia</hi> to make known thy valour, defending thy owne iuſtice with thy proper perſon, by honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable meanes, and not by ſo infamous a manner. And that thou maiſt know what wrong is done me, I here alone challenge the fight againſt two knights, whom thou ſhalt appoynt about this matter, or if thou wilt like a good knight accept my gage, I defie thée, perſon to perſon, giuing thée aduantage for the combat, (that thou mayeſt ſée and know my iuſtice) I will combat on foote in armour, without weapons, as ſword, dagger, and launce, and thou ſhalt take the fielde, and haue thy choiſe in armes.</p>
               <p>So great was the aduantage, that it was able to turne a tender Lambe vnto a fierce Lyon, and not regarding his honour, hee did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it preſently, from which the king could not diſſwade him. None in the Hall, except the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Prince, but iudged the knights challenge to procéed of meere madneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:26"/>
                  <hi>Don Eleno</hi> as he had done nothing, demaunded the battell to be ſtraight, firſt requiring the priſoners to be brought in field. Who were ſtraight aduertiſed thereof. The Gréeke was nothing aſtoniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, well knowing the fury of his vncle. The priſoners ſurely guarded, were conducted to a Scaffold of purpoſe made for ſuch matters. They gréeted one another as their affection did deſerue, with ioy, hoping for the good ſucceſſe of the battel. For <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> knowing the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, doubted not of victory. On foote did the <hi>Dacian</hi> enter the fielde without any weapon: which the Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi> carried, and his page ledde his horſe to giue it. The Combat ended, with a leape did the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gallant take the Liſts, compaſſing it about with ſuch quicke paces, as he were mounted. Then ſtood he ſtill, gladly gazing how the Citie did vnpeople it ſelfe to ſée the Combat.</p>
               <p>The Ladies with their bewties made that place a Paradice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Layſſa</hi> feared, ſéeing the Prince in ſo doubtfull a fight.

In midſt of his ſhield were two Harts enchayned, with this word.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:27"/>Of gallant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution ſéemed the Pagan, with the great companies that accompanied him, euerie one aſſured of his conqueſt, ſéeing him with ſuch aduantage: beſides, reputing him of forces inuincible. They equalled the ſunne betweene them, an auncient martiall cuſtome in warres of that qualitie. Oh <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> who might ſée thée on foote without weapons, feareleſſe awaight the comming of thy valiant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, who at the fearefull trumpets ſound prickt foorth, making the earth with hoarſe noiſe eccho the trampling of his horſes hoofes. The <hi>Dacian</hi> ſtayed for him couragiouſly, onely fearing the incounter in the cloſing of the horſe. Leaping aſide, he made him looſe the blow, and with ſuch furie paſſe foorth his carrier, that his ſhield had almoſt leapt out of the liſts. Twiſe was he ſo ſerued, but the third he changed of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for brandiſhing with mightie force the launce with ſuch ſeleritie, he caſt it at him, that his was not ſufficient to make him ſhun the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it vpon his amorous breaſt, it could not pearce it, for that onely Loue had done, ſo making him a little ſtagger backe, while it reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded backe. Oh admirable act, in the end worthie the <hi>Dacian</hi> Lord: for with more furie taketh not the towring Eagle her flight after her pray, then doth <hi>Don Eleno</hi> follow the retorted lance, he tooke it in the ayre, and turned merely vppon the Pagan, at him hee let it flie with more horror, then had it béen ſent through a cannons mouth. Againſt his ſtrength there is no defence, for it plainely pearced his ſhield, &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him very dangerouſly below the nauell, with a mightie fall hee made him meaſure his length on the earth, with ſuch aſtoniſhment of the beholders, that they knew not what meanes to finde to praiſe the knights valour. The lance was broken in two, which did not a little content the Prince, he tooke it vp quicker then the rauenous kite ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the tender chicke. By this came <hi>Lindauro,</hi> with his ſhielde and ſword in hand, thinking quickly to ende the fight, and with a floriſh would haue ſtrooke the <hi>Dacian,</hi> entring with a thruſt: As ſure of his armes as of his ſtrength was the Prince, ſo ſtanding faſt on his féete, ſuffered him to enter. Great was the blowe he receiued, but hee with the trunchion in hand gaue him one, that ſet all former ones in obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou, for bringing the lances péece right ouer his head vppon the helme, diſcharged it ſo puiſſantly, that voyding infinit blood throgh his noſtrels and mouth, he tumbled him headlong to the ground. Suddainly he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, for it was no time of delaies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:27"/>But he was met wit an other, that almoſt had againe feld him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe would not the Pagan doubt the victorie, and drawing ſtrength from weakneſſe, let flie at the toppe of the <hi>Dacians</hi> helme, it turned his an one ſide more then he wiſht. Enter he wold with another, but ere he could ſway his ſword about, the Prince made him feele the forcible waight of his trunchion, therewith making his ſhield and head méete, that it ſtopt the paſſage of his breath. Cloſe he would with him, but the Pagan brauely ſet his ſword in the middle, with the poynt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and thruſt him away ſo ſtrongly, that he was forced backe thrée or foure ſteppes.</p>
               <p>He followed him with a blowe on the helme, which put the <hi>Dacian</hi> to ſome paine, but all redowned to the Pagans harme, for <hi>Don Eleno</hi> being now extreamly incenſed, avoyded another, and cloſed with him, caſting his ſtrong arme about his necke. A while continued they wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling, but in the end, with a grone the <hi>Dacian</hi> laide him on the ground vpon his backe. On his breaſt he ſet his knées, ſaying. Dead art thou Prince <hi>Lindauro,</hi> vnleſſe thou doeſt vnſay what thou haſte ſaid, commaunding the priſoners to bee brought hither and ſet at libertie, with their horſes, armes, and weapons, ſince againſt all lawe and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice they haue been ſo long detained. All is ended with my vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (replied the afflicted <hi>Saracin.</hi>)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dacian</hi> intreated the Iudges to come and take the Pagans confeſſion, who ſent vnto the King to liberate the knights, with all that was theirs, ſince his fortune was ſo aduerſe againſt him. Their horſes and armes being brought in preſence of them all, they were armed. Where with great kindnes the <hi>Perſian</hi> offred his loue to the Gréeke, for as great amitie grew betwéene them, as euer was among their fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claridiano</hi> receiued him, ſaying. I was aſſured (gallant Prince) I could nor I ſhould not receiue any good without your preſence: my good will deſerues it, for in all things it ſhall procure your content. Whereto he anſwered. Great is that I receiue (heroicke Prince) to haue found the time wherein I might enioy your ſight, and far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould I haue conceiued, had I taken part of the troubles I was tolde you indured: although where this happie Prince hath imployed his power, my little indeuor were but néedleſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:28"/>I acknowledge my ſelfe ſo bound vnto you al (replied <hi>Claridiano</hi>) that I will proteſt no more, ſaue that you in deſire, and this Prince in doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, haue accompliſht the dutie of your valours, and fulfilled my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>But let vs now go to take our leaues of this peruerſe malicious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on whom I vow ere I depart from <hi>Eſclauonia,</hi> to be fully reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at my pleaſure, and their dammage. All foure that were the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of armes, went togither to the window, where the king was, to whom that euerie one might heare, the ſuſpitious knight, ſpake thus. I am very ſorry (king of <hi>Eſclauonia</hi>) in thy Court to haue ſéene ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tumultuous brawles, where had you obſerued and vnwronged kept euery ones iuſtice, according to the fame that for ſo iuſt a king doth ſo blazon you, to be throughout the ſpacious territories of the worldes wide regions, they had not procéeded ſo farre foorth, although theſe knights and my ſelfe may truely ſay, that if we diſpleaſed thée, thou haſte at pleaſure ſatiſfied thy ſelfe, to the deare coſt of our quiet, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in daunger the liues of ſuch knights, a thing that the very hearing doth offend, how much the more hauing taken ſo vniuſt reuenge, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thy ſelfe thereto by a blinde ſelfe voluntarie paſſion, and not by royal, wiſe, and diſcréet reaſon.</p>
               <p>And leaſt thou ſhouldeſt hereafter pretend ignorance, knowe thou haſte iniuried ſuch Princes, that will ſtraightly call thée to ſtrickt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all theſe wrongs. Of whence, or what you be, and of your pride and inſolencie, we néede not care to know, (ſaid the king) for it manifeſtly appeares in your laſt committed faults. And that you may ſée how little I reſpect your haughtie menaces, I commaund you on paine of death, to depart my kingdome within theſe foure daies, if not, Ile ſéek, &amp; till the death purſue you with an hoſte of armed men. Before this had wee determined our departure (replied <hi>Pollidolpho</hi>) abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring longer to abide in Court, whoſe king ſo little doth reſpect true iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and ſo do I hope to ſée the time thou ſhalt thy ſelfe confeſſe the euil committed, to be ruled by the opinion of ſelf paſſionate men, whom fortune hath rewarded according to their malicious intent. Plainly vnderſtood <hi>Lindaura</hi> it was ment by him, but vrgent neceſſitie was betwéene them, that he durſt not ſpeake.</p>
               <p>They departed from the king, leauing him readie to burſt with rage, and <hi>Lindaura</hi> in the ſame manner, that had no other comfort,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:28"/>
but to thinke his eſtate ſufficient to warre againſt the whole world. He required ſince all matters were quietted, to be married to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Father could not denie it, being pleaſed therewith, nor the Lady might not recall her word giuen to obey him, although ſhe deferred the day, alleadging ſhe and her damzels were working certaine things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that time, which forced her to deferre it eight or tenne daies, for ſéeing they were aſſured of her graunt, that terme was little. Her father reioyced, and much more the diſhonoured Louer of <hi>Liconia,</hi> to ſée that for all his troubles and vnhappie chances, he obtained his <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Who altogither of a contrary deſire, ſought meanes how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the Prince, and to conferre with them of her reſolution. The Gréeke well knew it, who being without the Cittie, taking ſome reſt at the fountaine, although it was ſome to be at libertie, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuch friends as thoſe, on whom for their valors a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that, and difficulter might be repoſed: He expreſſed his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thus.</p>
               <p>So great is my ſoules ioy (mightie Princes of <hi>Dacia</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>) that my tongue cannot expreſſe it, in that it pleaſed the reuoluing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of vnconſtant time, to order your commings hither, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> promiſed, without your handes had béene impoſſible for him to atchiue. Before the king impriſoned mee, my helpe was craued by his daughter, againſt the force her father would commit, to match her with a huſband ſhe diſliked, to whom I offered my perſon, ſo did this warlike Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> louing (as her beautie doth deſerue no leſſe) the faire <hi>Venus,</hi> and of himſelfe he made her ſole Empreſſe. I well perceieud it, preſuming more then my ſtrength could beare, promiſing to ſet her in his handes, in deſpight of the <hi>Syconian Sophy,</hi> to whom ſhe is aſſured by the king, becauſe hée is ſo great a Lord. In priſon talking with her, and telling her my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſhe altogither yéelded thereto, and that ſhee would in nothing contradict me. So muſt I now go to her preſence, and reſolue her of my intent, that according to our time limitted, wee may vſe the moſt conuenienteſt remedie. I do therefore intreate your aduiſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in theſe waightie affaires: The <hi>Dacian</hi> thus replied. I knowe none here (excellent Prince, that will deny his ayde vnto ſo mightie a Lord, as the Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> and therefore there is no reaſon, but
<pb facs="tcp:13978:29"/>
we all hazard our liues to woorke his content, and moreouer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooues me to take from hence the bewteous <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> for hauing bought her libertie at ſo beare a rate, I wil not leaue her in a ſtraungers po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: for I intende to intreate the Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi> to carry her vnto his Empire, til I otherwiſe doo purpoſe: and the company of ſo braue a Lady will be gréeuous to none. And ſince we be héere togither, I I am of opinion that the Prince of <hi>Greece</hi> goe to night to knowe the Ladies reſolution, and againſt when they will bee readie to depart thence. Whereto the <hi>Croatian</hi> Lord thus ſaid.</p>
               <p>I cannot moſt excellent Warriours, and ſoueraigne Princes, proteſt, nor binde my ſelfe to more then I haue alreadie, only this, I can within two dayes, haue heere twelue thouſande men that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my comming to the ſea, that til I commaund them the contrary wil not depart from thence. And within the Citie I haue fiftie knights and two Gyants to helpe vs if we ſhall néede their aide. And we may ſafely vnſéene go to our lodging in the Citie, and there order our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Euery one was glad that the Prince was ſo well prouided, and leſt longer delaie ſhould prooue more harmefull, they ſtraight moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tooke their way backe towards the Citie. They entred vnto their lodging vnſéene of any, through the obſcuritie of the night. From thence they ſent two of the chiefeſt of the fiftie knights, to poſte to the Sea ſide, to commaund the Captaines and Leaders of the ſouldiers, that euery Commaunder ſhould leade the moſt and beſt of their charge vnto the Valley of the Louers, and that the reſt ſhould be in vigilant readineſſe, guarding the Gallies. The knights obeyed moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they that intirely loued their Prince, being alſo of his ſubiects ſo affected.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke Prince leauing them, onely with his ſword and the ſtrong priuie Coate that <hi>Venus</hi> gaue him, he left his Chamber, taking the next way to the Garden, which was the place he thought to meete the Lady at, which indéed was ſo. For accompanied with <hi>Fauſta</hi> and <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> whom ſhe had made partaker of her Loues, and alſo how ſhe eſtéemed the Perſian Prince, were both determined to go with them, being aſſured what great Princes they were, if that meanes might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre that vniuſt marriage. <hi>Claridiano</hi> comming to the doore, gaue his ſignall, which <hi>Fauſta</hi> knowing, opened, ſaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:29"/>In faith ſir knight, I now ſée you cannot but be happie in your owne Loues, being ſo carefull of anothers. The Prince thereto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>This is my vnhappineſſe, to ſée by experience anothers faith well guerdoned, and liue my ſelfe in the greateſt diſpaire that euer knight in the world did. It may be (anſwered ſaid ſhe) you are onely euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned: for by all your other parts, you deſerue the wide worlds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. That is not ſo much (ſaid the gallant Prince) as my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is great that guides it this way. Well leaue we this (replied ſhe) and go we where my Lady and the faire <hi>Laiſſa</hi> doo expect you: and haue patience, for this is but the touchſtone, whereon the Ladie by true proofe makes triall of the Louer.</p>
               <p>By this came the two Ladies fairer then <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> ſtepping foorth, ſaid. I did ſo greatly feare, diſpairing knight, that ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelfe at libertie, you would eaſily forget whom you left in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I thought beſt to get company to ſéek you abroad, if you ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſhould tarry, and with my owne hands take my reuenge, which ſhould not be litle rigorous. Had I bene happie diuine Ladies (ſaid the Prince) as to haue knowne this reſolution, to féele the pleaſure that wounds giuen by thoſe your ſacred hands doo yéeld, I would not haue ſo ſoone returned. But yet knowing the falling into any forgetfulneſſe in you ſeruice, how litle ſoeuer, was paine intollerable, inforced me ſo ſoone to haſten my comming, to be reſolued of your will, the which thoſe Princes nor my ſelfe wil in nothing contradict. I loue ſo truly to kéepe my word inuiolate heroicke Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> (anſwered the Ladie) that I know not what more to ſay: ſauing this, I doo altogither ſubmit my fortunes to your order, which during life I wil obſerue, aſſured that ſuch a knight wil reſpect my poore immacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honour, the which although in ſome reſpect I doo repugne, yet to fruſtrate my intended marriage, I wil venture my perſon in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peril you ſhal vndergo: therefore in this, there is no more to doo but plot it as you thinke beſt, for that is our determination. And ſince the Gods haue in all things made you ſo abſolute, doo not gréeue if I take this Ladie in my company: For ſhée will in no caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine any longer in my Fathers Court, whileſt I abſent my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:30"/>In charge had I that you laſt ſpake of (ſaide the Prince) from my Lord and Vncle the Prince of <hi>Dacia:</hi> but ſéeing ſhe is pleaſed with what we al deſired, let vs no longer procraſtinate our iourney, making all things readie for the ſame two daies hence, in which time you may ſend to our lodging thoſe things you ſhall bee beſt pleaſed to take with you. Be it as you haue ſaid (ſoueraigne Prince, ſaid <hi>Venus</hi>) for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in our defence the mightie <hi>Alphebos</hi> ſonne, it is nothing wee haue vndertaken, were it farre harder.</p>
               <p>Occaſion they had to demaund for the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which being not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, things paſſed ſo plainly, that the Gréeke reioyced to ſée his friend ſo well imployed. Any ones good would glad him, though hée himſelfe did want it. He tooke his leaue of the Ladies with a thouſand imbracements, that had not <hi>Archiſilora</hi> gouerned his ſoule, and the reaſon of his thoughts, it were no wonder had he ſtood a while ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the content thereof: but he with one ordinarie courteſie in liew of ſo many fauours, left them, of themſelues iealous with feare of that they ſhould do, although their comfort was, that ſuch Princes had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke their ſafetie.</p>
               <p>They ſtraight beganne to order the preparations for their iourney from <hi>Xantho.</hi> While the valourous Gréeke returned to the Princes, that receiued him with excéeding ioy, relating to them all their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with the Ladies reſolution, which not a little contented them, and moreouer ſaid. And I haue newe commends to the haughtie <hi>Branſiniano,</hi> Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> for the Ladies demaunded for none but him, and I am glad in my heart to knowe how matters paſſe, and in faith I had not thought the <hi>Dacian</hi> Lord to bee ſo warie. Valiant Gréeke (ſaid <hi>Don Eleno</hi>) knowe, that in matters of Loue, the greateſt concealement is greateſt fire, for nothing contents <hi>Cupid</hi> more, then to ſée how by the ſole motion of the eyes two agres, concluding more with the ſight, then others in an age, in preſent daily continual diſcourſes. For nothing better blazoneth the ſoules newes, then the eyes, and if they ſo could, no maruell they be agréed, and greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can Loue ſo effect.</p>
               <p>So with great content did they all expect the ſecond day, to take the Ladies from the Pallace: for the men they ſent for, were by that come to the place appoynted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:30"/>The next day <hi>Fauſta</hi> ſent thrée or foure of the Ladies cheſts, and the one and the others, awaited the darkneſſe of the approaching night, wherin befell them what the next following Chapter doth reſite.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. How the Princes conueyed the Ladies out of the Pallace. The battell they had about them with the Kings Knights: and what more happened.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lreadie had the ſtarrie canabey of heauen darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the earth with clowdie blacke obſcuritie, when the foure mightie valiant warriours clad all in rich and ſtrong abilements of warre, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the two fierce gyants and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie knights, (leauing the reſt to guard the Ladies Coffers, and to aduertiſe the armie of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach) arriued cloſely at the Garden gate, and making the accuſtomed ſigne, <hi>Fauſta</hi> with more courage opened, where they found the Ladies ſo amazed with feare, that they had no power to vtter one word.</p>
               <p>It was no time for ceremonies, ſo <hi>Claridiano</hi> taking <hi>Venus</hi> in his armes, carried her out of the garden, and deliuering her to the Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> ſaid. Receiue this gift (ſir knight) for by doing it, I can-cel the bonds of my ingaged word. He could not anſwer, being ouercloied with ioy, nor yet could ſhe do otherwiſe. He returned like the winde for <hi>Laiſſa,</hi> (that more courage had then the other) hauing indured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perils, and gaue her to the Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whoſe gladneſſe did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed the greateſt in the world.</p>
               <p>He forgot not <hi>Paliſandro,</hi> for almoſt he plainly conceiued what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Tower, ſo deliuering <hi>Fauſta</hi> vnto him, ſpake. Since thou canſt ſo well diſſemble, thou deſerueſt to haue her in kéeping. The Damzell was wittie and ſo replied. I would not (ſir knight) that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue played your owne parts, you ſhould thus ill rewarde me.</p>
               <p>The want of power to care for ſo many (kinde <hi>Fauſta</hi>) hath forced
<pb facs="tcp:13978:31"/>
mee to commit you to his guarding, that knows what torments do poſſeſſe me. Therevppon <hi>Don Elenos</hi> Dwarffe ſtept in with theſe words. I faith Prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> if you vſe to pay all your Squires in this manner, it will make mee rebell againſt <hi>Don Eleno</hi> my Lord, for he liuing ſecure, remembers not vs that be ſo deſtitute of fauours. The <hi>Dacian</hi> made anſwere. The not knowing thy minde (friend <hi>Leſbio</hi>) was cauſe I procured not thy remedie, but now I knowe thy will, I will ere long ſatiſfie thy content. With many ieſtes at length they arriued at their armie, where after they reſted, the Gréeke would diſcharge his ſoule of part of her cares, wedding the beautious <hi>Venus</hi> to the gallant <hi>Pollidolpho,</hi> with ſuch content of all the hoſte, that feared they not to be heard, had expreſt it with applauding ſhouts. Here me thinkes (ſaid <hi>Eleno</hi>) all the world flies from farther toyle, which being ſo, I will alſo do it, by leauing the protection of this ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie, ſo beſtowing her to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> he ſaide. To you (ſir Knight) muſt I deliuer her, being deſtitute of ſtrength to guard her.</p>
               <p>So well did <hi>Venus</hi> plead, knowing how the <hi>Perſian</hi> was affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that foorthwith they were both eſpowſed, to their admirable ioy. Content in pleaſant chat, were theſe Princes, and alſo beeing night, it was not much if they enioyed any ſecret ioyes, I knowe not, but to increaſe their pleaſure, the ſenceleſſe trées were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>While they were in their iollitie, no little hurleburley had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the King and Princes quiet ſuppoſed reſt of troubles in the Pallace, for going to ſupper, the Ladies were miſt: they entred their chamber, where they found nothing but a letter, whoſe tenour was. That <hi>Venus</hi> was departed, wedded to <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> Prince of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atia,</hi> a Knight that for merits of perſon and ſtate, deſerued no leſſe then <hi>Venus:</hi> and <hi>Laiſſa</hi> vnder the Protect of <hi>Branſiniano</hi> Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> backt and defended by the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> and <hi>Tribizound,</hi> togither with the valiant Lord of <hi>Dacia.</hi> The King was not a little daunted hearing thoſe names, ſéeing how hard it was for him to bee reuenged, they being ſuch mightie Princes: neuertheleſſe hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded fortie thouſand knights to be preſently armed, and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in two ſquadrons, to follow in fearch of them, for imagining they were alone, thought that méeting them, they would bee eaſily fetcht backe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:31"/>One of the Squadrons the furious <hi>Lindauro</hi> did lead with the Kings cooſin. The <hi>Saracin</hi> was pollitique, and ſo ſuppoſing they might bee in the Louers Wood, which made him with ſwift ſteppes enter into the ſame, although the Princes hadde tane ſome other way.</p>
               <p>All that night he loſt himſelfe, vntill the next morning that hee met with ſome ſhéepheards, of whome hee demaunded for them: they gaue him good tokens to haue ſéene them: telling him alſo that they were marched towards the ſea. He turned about in all haſte with his men in their purſuite, not demaunding whether they had any company or no: but ſo faſt hyed the Princes, that ere they were ouertaken, <hi>Phoebus</hi> was paſt the middeſt of his dyurnall courſe, and were ſo neare the ſea, that from the Gallies they might beholde them.</p>
               <p>The Princes (ſéeing they were but fewe more in number then they) iudged it cowardize, not to let them know, how they were incenſt againſt them. So agreed to ſtay, committed the ladies to 100. knights, to conuey them to their ſhips, and deuided their battell into two parts. The ore was commanded by <hi>Don Eleno</hi> and <hi>Branſiniano:</hi> and the other, guided the mightie Gréeke, with the new Bridegroome, who was one of the ſkilfulleſt in the world, to diſpoſe and order a battell.</p>
               <p>In Figure of a halfe Moone, they awaighted their enemies, that ſéeing them not to be ſo many as themſelues, couragiouſly prepared to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile them, hoping the reſt would alſo arriue to them: and with more eaſe to get the conqueſt, they approached with the noiſe of innumerable inſtruments, and in good order: for the Kings Coozen was a polliticke Knight. Worthy of ſéeing was their encountring: for though it was of no puiſſant hoſtes, yet ſo great was the horror, as if one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand men had met. Foure did diſpayring <hi>Lindauro</hi> ouerthrow before he brake his Launce: for the gréefe to ſée his Lady in an others power, did incourage him: he drew forth his ſword, and with it, in company of <hi>Tarſides</hi> (ſo was the kings cooſen named) began to performe wonders, onely they maintaining the heate of the fight. But that way the foure Heroycke Princes entred, no tongue can expreſſe their déeds, for they ſéemed no other then the reapers in the moneth of Iuly among the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened corne: for their remorceleſſe blowes found no reſiſt, that ſhields, helmes, armor, heads, bodies, and ſometimes horſes and all were ſundred in the middeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:32"/>No leſſe dammage did the Gyants in their furious paſſage with their battle-axe.</p>
               <p>Admirable was the battle at this time, to heare the pitteous clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the wounded, the claſhing of armor and weapons, with the reſounding noyſe of cutting ſtrokes, and the running about the field of horſes maiſterleſſe. So ill did not the Eſclauonians behaue themſelues, but they kild being killed, not ſo much procuring the defence of their owne liues, as their enemies deaths. Thrée houres endured the fight, without vantage knowne on either ſide: for the inhabitants would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, then ſuffer their Princeſſe violently by ſtraungers to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away: but in the end of that terme, the Princes being heated in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the field had fewe to reſiſt their mortall wounds, for euery blowe was the death of a knight.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> and <hi>Lindauro</hi> met, either by their deuiſes knew the other. Glad was the <hi>Croatian</hi> of the incounter, greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, ſo ſaid. Now is the time proud Prince, to ſhewe your déedes in fields, to be otherwiſe then words in the Pallace. Without admitting any anſwere, he did let flie at his Helme, on the outward ſide, all the Plumes and the crooked top he ſtrooke away, making him ſhamefully bend in the ſaddle, and with another ſtroke laide him ſenceleſſe along his horſe. There he had ſlaine him, had not <hi>Tarſides</hi> arriued, ſtaying him with a furious thruſt, and giuing <hi>Lindauro</hi> time to recouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both at once, not reſpecting the lawes of knighthood, charged the <hi>Croatian.</hi> But the venturous Louer brauely withſtood them, giuing and receiuing mightie blowes.</p>
               <p>Altogither apparantly did the Eſclauonians looſe the field. For wanting moſt of their beſt Leaders, moſt pittifull was the bloodie maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre made of them. Not far off was their remedie, for at the Sunnes declining from the fourth houre, on the top of an hillocke, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Kings ſtandard, with the other twentie thouſand men. Who ſeeing the battle in thoſe termes, prickt foorth in all haſte, to ſuccor their friends that were vtterly diſcomfited. Great hurt did they vppon the <hi>Crotians,</hi> which alſo feared ſome vnluckie hap, ſo fierce was their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
               <p>Foure more magnanimious knights then the Princes, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſéene: for though their enemies be treble thrée to one, their valour doth ſupply their want of multitude. Order was giuen none ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:13978:32"/>
harme or touch the king for <hi>Venus</hi> ſake. Who waighing the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the fight, commaunded the halfe of foure thouſand men that kept the Gallies, ſhould ſtand to ayde their Lords. It was to no ſmall effect. For arming themſelues, preſently they obeyed, taking their way towards the hotteſt of the fight. As they went, two knights of admirable diſpoſition, and in rich armes met them, and learning the cauſe of that conflict, determined to ayde the Ladie. Good was their helpe, being the two ſtrong Princes, <hi>Don Argante</hi> of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> and <hi>Thoriſiano,</hi> that togither wandred to ſéeke their aduentures. They entred crying <hi>Croatia,</hi> when they beganne to driue backe. But theſe newe ſuccours was a meane to regaine their loſt aduantage, and ſet their aduerſaries hope in daunger. Sundred were <hi>Tarſides</hi> and <hi>Lindauro,</hi> and vnhappily did <hi>Tarſides</hi> fall into <hi>Don Elenos</hi> hands, whom he had incenſed.</p>
               <p>This occaſion would not he looſe, for with both hands he diſcharged <hi>Brutus</hi> ſword vpon his ſhield, it yéelds no defence, for in two it was parted, and with the ſwords poynt did wound him daungerouſly on his head. Hee cloſed with him, and for <hi>Venus</hi> ſake would not kill him. But caſting his ſtrong armes about him, ſpurred his <hi>Tyrio,</hi> and ſnatcht him from his ſaddle, that being altogither breathleſſe, hée deliuered him to foure knights, to conuey him to the Princeſſe <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> The battell was cruelly renewed, and dead bodies lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly falling on both ſides: but the Princes being inuincible, where ere they went, were aſſured of the victorie. Clearly had they obtained it, if <hi>Phoebus</hi> haſtening his Weſterne downfall, had not hid his light in <hi>Thetis</hi> watrie lap, leauing almoſt half of the <hi>Eſclauonians</hi> dead, with foure thouſand <hi>Croatians,</hi> beſides the wounded.</p>
               <p>On either ſide retrait was ſounded, for feare of the nights ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. <hi>Pollidelpho</hi> being in warre moſt polliticke, commaunded many fiers to be lighted, that his enemies might thinke they would ſtay til the morrow: which he nothing leſſe minded, iudging it mere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, becauſe the king had his ſuccors ſo neare, and they theirs ſo far off, marcht away to the ſea ſide, cauſing all manner of lights in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes to be fired, that the ſouldiers might imbarke themſelues. They did ſo, leauing neuer a man on land, except the two Princes, whom another aduenture expected.</p>
               <p>The next morrow, the Pagans thinking their enemies had ſtayed,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:33"/>
ſcarce had <hi>Aurora</hi> welcommed <hi>Apollo</hi> the Eaſt, when they began in rankes and files orderly to draw their men in field. No griefe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that which the king and <hi>Lindauro</hi> conceiued, being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their ſpies what happened. So ſoone as it was knowne they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed towards the ſhore, thinking to ouertake them: but being thither come, were aſſured of theyr departure, which made the King &amp; Prince moſt wofully, with bitter laments to exclaime: and more, miſſing their kinſman <hi>Tarſides,</hi> they wanted preſent means to follow them, which forced their returne to <hi>Xantho:</hi> where they gaue order to prepare all the ſhipping in the land. The like did the Sophi, knowing how his ſon was mocked. They gathered 600. ſayles, which was the moſt famous Fléete that euer came on thoſe ſeas. They waſted 200. thouſand men, and 400. Giants, of the fierceſt in the world: with ſo great and puiſſant armies, he thought he might make warre vpon the greateſt Potentate therof. <hi>Lindauro</hi> was appointed Generall by ſea and land: that had hée not bene troubled with fantaſticke vaine imaginary boaſtes, he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the office with immortall Fame. Some time was ſpent in the preparation and aſſembling of this mightie army, in which ſeaſon, the Princes with their ſayles ſpread in the winde, feareleſſe of any thing, with their Ladies ioying in their company, within eight dayes landed at <hi>Geua,</hi> the chiefeſt hauen in all <hi>Croatia.</hi> The inhabitants receiued the Princes with ſuch ioy and coſtly triumphes, that to ſhun prolixitie, wée ouerpaſt day by day, the rumor ſtil increaſt of <hi>Lindauros</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: For which cauſe, as alſo for the ladies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were with child, they intreated the princes to abide with them til they were in peace, or with aſſurance of agréement with <hi>Venus</hi> father: who knowing the impriſonment of her Coozen <hi>Tarfides,</hi> procured his libertie, with ſuch entertainment as his merits deſerued. It did ſo win him, as alſo ſéeing how well beflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Coozen was, that he determined to pacifie the proclaimed wars. Therupon he writ to the king of <hi>Eſclauonia,</hi> alleaging what honor and greater diſaduantage he incurred to perſecute his daughter, ſince ſhee had choſen for her huſband, the Prince <hi>Pollidolpho,</hi> rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if ſhe gaue her promiſe of marriage to <hi>Lindauro,</hi> it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pleaſe his honor, and not to ſatiſfie her owne will, hauing before made it obedient to an others command. This letter a thouſand times made him ſo recant his intent, as he was about ſo often to haue ſhewn it the Prince, yet he could not ſo cloſe kéep it, but he diſcerned it. Who

diſſembling, ſéemed to take no notice of it, ſo that for all that, they ſet their fortunes on the feas, purpoſing to land in <hi>Croatia.</hi> They had done it, and it had béene one of the cruelleſt warre in the world, if the wiſe <hi>Nabato</hi> (conſidering his <hi>Don Eleno</hi> was there detained thereby) had not ſuccoured them, by croſſing the huge King with ſtormes and tempeſts, that the third part of the Fléete was ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the deuouring waters. They returned to <hi>Eſclauonia,</hi> where taking counſell, <hi>Lindauro</hi> knowing that the Soldan of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> with the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> did aſſemble themſelues togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt <hi>Grecia,</hi> reſolued to ioyne with them, that with ſo many multitudes, his reuenge might be the more eaſier. As it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, he put it in execution, and repairing his tempeſt beaten ſhips, directed his voyage towards S. <hi>Georges</hi> promontory, where it was reported all the generall forces met. Thus far (admired Ladies) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded the ſole ſpoyle of the ioyes it procured, that by ſo many means ſought the eaſie paſſage for his reuenge, vpon the robbers of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: who without remembrance of what hee (poore ſoule) indured, paſt the time in ſports and reuels, till the ſeaſon of the Ladies deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was come, both who brought forth two Girles, whoſe beauties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their prime, darkened <hi>Apollos</hi> cleareſt light. The childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were borne with ſeuerall tokens: for the <hi>Perſians</hi> had on their breſts Loues bowe and quiuer of arrowes. <hi>Venus</hi> daughter had alſo in the breaſt, a hand whiter then the ſnow, that twixt the fingers held a heart as red as blood. Much adoo there was to name them, in the end it was remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who therein ſhewed the ſharpneſſe of his wit, for conſidering they had got the mothers by force of armes, named the <hi>Babylonian Helena:</hi> he did not ſo amiſſe, becauſe for her ſake there were no leſſe cruelwars, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Troye</hi> ſuſtained about the firſt, as it is in the fourth part of this Hiſtorie. <hi>Venus</hi> girle was called <hi>Pollixena,</hi> in remembrance of her whoſe loue ſo dearly Gréeke <hi>Archilles</hi> did abide. Euery one praiſed the wittie naming of the Ladies by the Prince, who expreſſed his ioy and loue in the performance of a famous iouſter. He craued leaue of the Ladies to depart, thinking he wronged his owne, to liue ſo long in thoſe pleaſures, which he obtained with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.

               <p>Wee cannot but credibly beléeue (moſt noble Prince) ſo illuſtrious a déed hath long ſince béene prophecied, with more diuine inſpirations, then humane determination: to corroborate our friendſhip, there was no cauſe to intimate this: for to obſerue the lawes of honourable true Loue, the leaſt ground with ſo coſtly experience, were ynough.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many and ſo certaine were ſhe newes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day were broght of the <hi>Nyquean</hi> Soldans mightie preparations, and of the aydes &amp; helpes hee demanded of his bordering neighbour kings, that although it were not giuen out, gainſt whom ſuch hoſtile aſſemblies of Pagan Infidelles were preſſed, yet would not the carefull Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſéeme careleſſe of his neceſſarie affaires: but rather commaunded <hi>Oriſtides</hi> the newe <hi>Theſſalian</hi> king, with al expedition to vnite, &amp; with new ſupplies to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen al his ſcattered troupes, and with them to march away along the neareſt of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies neighbouring holds, that their diligence might ſtay their haſte. He obeyed, accompanied with his <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and executed his office ſo well, that in fewe daies he reparted on thrée frontiers, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two thouſand men. And leauing the Empire ſure that way, he withdrew himſelfe with fortie thouſand men towards <hi>Nyquea,</hi> to ſée if the enemie would aſſault any place on the ſudden. He performed it all with ſuch happie ſpéede, that his good diligence was to no ſmall effect, for that is it which ouercomes the moſt labourous toyle. The <hi>Troyans</hi> quicke expedition was no meanes to make the Emperour be ydle, but rather to ſhewe his great care. For of <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Greecians,</hi> he gathered a well furniſht armie, wherewith he accounted himſelf ſecure. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt, nor of thoſe that ſéemed remiſſe in theſe broils, was <hi>Toriſmundo</hi> none, but being aduertiſed of the affaires, he ſhipt himſelfe towards <hi>Spaine,</hi> where hee prouided all the gallies of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Sicely,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Portugall,</hi> whoſe direction <hi>Don Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerio</hi> commaunded them to obey. On the ſeas was not a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créeter knight ſéene, better to order and reprehend a battell. With fiue hundreth ſayles he began to plough the Weſtern <hi>Ocean,</hi> which contained the powers of <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> whereof
<pb facs="tcp:13978:35"/>
ſixtie hundred thouſand were Spaniards, with whoſe valor he doubted not to confront the proudeſt enemie. Of Portugalles 40. thouſand: whoſe ſkill on the ſea, excelled the ſkilfulleſt. The French king with conſent of the Prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> ſent vnder the Spaniſh Enſignes 90. thouſand well armed knights. Of all theſe men, he had made his Lieftenant Generall, his valiant ſon <hi>Corſelio.</hi> About the end of Aprill with all theſe powers, the furious <hi>Toriſmundo</hi> found himſelfe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt confines of his land, in ſight of <hi>Lauering,</hi> where ouerviewing all his Fléete, from the hatches of his Gallie, all in ſanguine armor raiſing his Beuer, and on a bloody Launce, he thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not néed moſt valiant knights to explicate in words, what great rewards a wel fought battle doth yéeld: nor what neuer dying ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is therby obtained, where rather a man muſt be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dead, holding his ſword within his hand, then for feare to haue it ſaid, he did force it. But ſince we wade within ſuch danger of our liues, I will no more remember ſaue the auncient blood from whence we do deſcend: ſince it was neuer ſaid of a French man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> killing he did flie. I will not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize the déeds of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where Fame theſe waſte ſeas can memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe more then what is reported, that her ordinance in millitarie diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is able to attempt the hardieſt enterpriſe. The which ſince wee haue ſufficient, conioyned with ſuch ſtrength, let vs imploy it all, for with ſo mightie forces, it were an eaſie matter to ruinate the whole world. The which, that it may be done with more courage, I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this war with fire and ſword, to be executed, yet intreating, that none to ſhew himſelfe valiant, become barbarouſly cruell: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as it doth blemiſh the deſerued reputation of a ſouldier. Where ending, the Admirall diſcharged thrée péeces of ordinance, as a ſigne that euery one ſhould be ready againſt the mornings Sun vpriſe, with outſpread ſayles, to recommend their Fortunes to the fauours of the windes and waues. A great encouragement to all the men were the Generalles animating words, whereat to expreſſe how feruently they were addicted to the warres, they all vnſheathed their ſwords, proclaiming the obedient faith due to their Prince, who with a merrie gale of winde ſet towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> aduertiſing the Emperor of his comming, who was not a little glad of his ayde.</p>
               <p>He entered the wide Hauen of <hi>Conſtaninople,</hi> diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all his groſe Artillerie, with ſuch noiſe, that heauen and
<pb facs="tcp:13978:35"/>
earth ſéemed to méet, al the Caſtles anſwered them with the like.</p>
               <p>There was none but came to the ſhore, to ſee the entrance of the Spaniſh Fléet. No leſſe gallant on land then a good ſouldier on Sea, would hee ſhewe himſelfe, landing all the Spaniards in good order, brauely attired, and euery one with a gréene ſcarfe a croſſe his breaſt, to diſtinguiſh them from the Frenchmen, that wore theirs read, and the Portugals ruſſet. In this maner he landed 50000. Spaniards, 30. thouſand Portugals, and fiftie thouſand French, leauing the reſt to guard and defend his Gallies. It excéedingly gladded the Emperor to ſée ſo well furniſhed men, and chiefly with father and ſonne, whom hauing neuer before ſéene, in his very ſoule he reioyced to ſée their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſpoſition. By land was alreadie arriued his deare <hi>Griſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> whoſe companie was moſt welcome to the Gréeke Ladies. The immeaſurable ioy cannot be expreſſed, which the Spaniards co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ſéeing the Dames of <hi>Greece,</hi> and as in warre no amorous thoughts were euer troubleſome to a ſouldier, ſo the dread command of angrie <hi>Mars,</hi> could not hinder them from the procurement of ſome ſwéet ſure reſt, in whoſe name they might imploy the valor of their perſons.</p>
               <p>This pleaſing life did little laſt, for the Emperour hauing true notice that his friends were comming to ſuccor him, reſolued to go &amp; ſéek his enemies, &amp; know gainſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch inumerable powers were aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled. On the other ſide, the abſence of his deare ſonnes much troubled him, for he had onely with him his ſonne <hi>Roſuler,</hi> that at <hi>Oliuas</hi> intreaties did ſtay. Alſo the furious <hi>Brandafidel</hi> was with him, on whoſe ſtrength he repoſed much hope.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke <hi>Alphebo</hi> had no néed of aduertiſement, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallitie of the warres was come vnto his eares, and ſo with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt power he could vnite, withdrew himſelfe to <hi>Tribizound,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Braminoro</hi> and <hi>Tefereo:</hi> who moſt gréeued at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abſence, was the beautious <hi>Archiſilora,</hi> attributing the lacke of <hi>Claridianos</hi> preſence to her owne ſtrangeneſſe: her ſorrow was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned by her outward ſemblance. No leſſe was <hi>Roſamondes</hi> to ſée her ſo: knowing the cauſe, it ſo tormented her, that for feare it ſhould be perceiued, ſhe reſolued to abſent her ſelfe, for commanding the Gouernors of her kingdome, ſhould with all conuenient ſpéede, conduct the greateſt power of well prouided men they could ſelect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:36"/>They accompliſht their Quéens beheft (for then ſhe, no Princeſſe was more with loue reſpected of ſubiects) ſending when time ſerued, fiftie thouſand of well armed men. The day before her departure, ſhee tooke her leaue of <hi>Roſamond</hi> with no fewe teares, for neuer betwéene two Ladies was ſuch ſimpathie of true amitie. Very importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe offered her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, but as any good ſocietie wold but aggrauate the Quéenes euill, ſhee would not admit it: ſaying ſhee might not leaue <hi>Greece</hi> and the Emperour in ſuch neceſſitie. Then her armes (being the beſt the world contained) ſhe preſented her. Them ſhee alſo refuſed, for <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had prouided her with ſuch as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit for ſafegard of her perſon: which were of the ſame colour as <hi>Claridianos,</hi> ſauing that the ſable barres were filled with flames of fire: on her ſhield was a gallant deuiſe, for out of a field full of odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous flowers, a Ladie ſéemed to go in ſearch of a knight, after whom ſhe in great haſte aſcended vp a craggie rocke, from whence ſhe looked after the content ſhe loſt: and the Motto betwéene them, thus.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Alone would the warlike warriour néeds go, thinking her gréefe a ſufficient company: all the Court ſorrowed for her abſence: but <hi>Lir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo</hi> aſſuring them of her ſafetie, their diſcontent was leſſened, mounted on a luſtie Courſer, ſhee croſt the woods of <hi>Greecia,</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on her Lord, calling her ſelfe a thouſand times moſt cruell, for that in being ſo, ſhee had loſt him: and by the loſſe, obtained ſo great torments. Shee ſhipt her ſelfe in a barke bound for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to trauell the whole world, in pennance of her folly. One night among the reſt, while the warriours ſlept, ſhe walked (as ſhe vſed) on the hatches, with her lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to make the watrie dwellers partakers of her gréefes: at ſuch time that another barke ſayled by hers, from whence might be heard ſome entermingled grones with ſighes. She could not knowe what it was, ſo ſwift it went away. After it with all poſſible ſpéede, with ores and ſayles, ſhe commaunded hers ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: it was done with ſuch diligence, till ſhee ouertooke the barke, wherein ſhee ſawe a Knight complaine of Loue and Fortune thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:36"/>Ay me vnfortunate Prince (ſaid the knight) is it poſſible there ſhould be no euill, but the extreameſt ſower it containes, my perplexed ſoule ſhuld féele? Why ſhould I hope for any good, when with mine eyes I ſée it flie from me? There is no inconuenience but haunts me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept death, with whom I cannot be acquainted. Oh Gréekiſh Prince, how happily mayeſt thou call thy ſelfe happie, by being in thy infancie brought vp with the ſoueraigne of my life, and hearts direction, ſince that was an occaſion for the obtaining of thoſe rights ſolely due to to me. Oh <hi>Liriano,</hi> (thy name being ſufficient to aſſwage the gréefe that me torments) who might by ſacrificing my life into thy hands, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thée in faith thy Louer deſerue not compariſon with me.

Wherein haue I offended thée? when diſobeyd I thy commands? when violated I thy lawes? aboliſhed thy rights? or when did my painfull thoughts harbor or conceiue the leaſt imagination againſt thy honour or deitie? If this be ſo, and not vnknown to thée, why doeſt thou wound him with ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, that is orborne with weakneſſe, and thy diſaſtrous chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Oh how many any (pardon me faire Ladies) be hereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident on your perfections, your crueltie being as great as your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are incomparable, if you reward him that can loue, like him that onely liues to hate?</p>
               <p>No more could the Ladie heare, for the barke was guided by <hi>Lupertio,</hi> but what ſhe heard was ynough to increaſe her paine, and raiſe ſome doubt, that the named Prince was he whom ſhe loued.

               <p>A ſhower of infinit teares rained the Quéene downe her pearled théekes, procéeding from the extremitie of loue: hauing ſo done, ſéeing her ſelfe comfortleſſe, and not knowing whom to aſke for, hauing no notice of the Gréekes deuiſe, ſhe began to giue vent vnto her ſwelling thoughts, ſinging theſe verſes.</p>

               <p>With a heauie ſigh ſhee ended: but as if ſinging had but in part diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged her ſorrowes, ſhe beganne with ſaying to proſecute them as followeth. Ay me! Quéen of <hi>Lyra,</hi> (ſaid the Ladie) that hauing no cauſe to complaine, do ſuffer thus deſeruedly, a iuſt pay for ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. Of whom elſe might I hope to bee loued, beeing by the Gréeke Prince adored? On the earth, of whom couldſt thou expect any good, if not from thy Gréeke? Oh woe is me, that the truſt of my ſmall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhould bring me to this paſſe, that I muſt make the winds witneſſe of my paines: and that to my vnblemiſht honours coſt, I muſt hue and wander by ſea and land, demaunding for him <hi>Archy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiloras</hi> loue: when I mought haue liued with ioy, with pleaſure, and in quiet, by giuing him a little ſigne of that happineſſe, I my ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by being his: but ſéeing it is thus brought about, loue I will, and patiently embrace this iuſt impoſed toyle.</p>
               <p>Here was her languiſhment renewed, ſéeing a knight come direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards her ſhippe, lying a long the hatches of another, exclaiming againſt <hi>Cupids</hi> ordinances. Who euer ſuffered (ſaid he) his heart to followe and ſéeke his owne diſhonour? What lawe allowes the ſoule to diſcloſe that, whoſe ſecrecie preſerueth no leſſe then life? Accidents be theſe onely incident in loue, for he as the King of extreames enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me, not regarding my fame, to procure anothers conſent.

What is become of thoſe ſwéete words at our parting thou ſpakeſt? where is the faith wherwithon my hands thou vowedſt loyaltie, proteſting, if any pleaſure thou ſhouldeſt haue, it would procéede only from thinking thou art mine? Thou doeſt ill guerdon the bountie wherewith I laide open vnto thée the ſecrets of my ſoule, making my ſelfe tributary vnknowne to whome. I did it when thou iudgedſt it newe life, newe ioy, newe eaſe, and newe content: But now altogither forgetfull, thou flieſt from me, that liue to loue thée.</p>
               <p>So ouerwhelmed in her owne thoughts was the bewteous <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizar,</hi> who departing from the furious <hi>Brauorant,</hi> followed the ſearche of the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> whom ſhée ſo intierly affected, that ſhée regarded not whether any heard her. By the complaints did <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſilora</hi> knowe her to be a Ladie, and pittying her, cauſed her Barke to be grappled with the other, and ſaide. No maruell (he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke Ladie) that ſince the lande hath alreadie beene acquainted with your conſtancie, you nowe participate your faith vnto theſe inhoſpitable waters. Be of good courage, for you haue company in your woes: and ſuch as wil neglect his owne to remedie yours. At the voyce roſe <hi>Floralindas</hi> daughter, and replied.</p>
               <p>Who are you (Syr Knight) that ſo kindly doo commiſerate my paine, which is the greateſt that euer was incloſed in any humane breaſt? I am hée, (ſaide <hi>Archiſilora</hi>) who with my ſoule (valiant Ladie) will procure your quiet: and therefore pray you, accept ſuch ſeruice as my Barke wil yéeld: for it may be, the recitall of your griefs to me, and I mine to you, wil be a mittigation of ſome ſorrow. Ile not forgo the enioying of ſo good company as that you offer mee (Syr knight) ſaid <hi>Floraliza,</hi> intreating I may know who you be that alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die knowes my gréefs? The Ladies gallant behauior had attracted the <hi>Lirian</hi> Matrons affection, who replied. In more then this doo I deſire to ſatiſfie you ſoueraigne Ladie, but firſt ſtep into my ſhip, where I wil do it at full. To know your name (anſwered <hi>Floraliza</hi>) a harder enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe would I attempt. So leapt ſhe into the Quéenes Barke, ſaying. Aduantage hath my Barke got (ſir knight) with my abſence, to which being alone, the winds and waters may now be more fauourable, then when I was in it, and ſince we haue this opportunitie, deare ſir, defer not my deſire. With neuer a word the haughtie Quéene vnlaced

her Helme, reſting more faire then was <hi>Latonas</hi> ſonne, when onely for loue he kept <hi>Admetus</hi> ſhéepe. <hi>Floralizas</hi> was alſo of, whoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was equalled by fewe, and that want was with valour ſupplied.</p>
               <p>Let it not gréeue you Soueraigne Lady ſaid the Quéene, that I knowe ſhe cauſe of your mones, for mine are no leſſe: which I ſuffer ſéeking for him, that ought to dye louing, but ſince I am the cauſe therof, it is reaſon I endure the extremitie of gréefe: and ſéeing loue hath equalled vs therein, Ile no longer kéepe from you who I am. So ſhe related vnto her euerie thing ſhe could, not naming <hi>Claridiano.</hi> Why now (ſaid <hi>Alicandros</hi> Néece) I do account my paine a pleaſure, being pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you, and haue aſſured hope we ſhall quickly finde redreſſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Quéene anſwered.</p>
               <p>Gladly would I know who he is to labor your content. Any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing I know not (replyed ſhe) more then that I am an others: for a brother of mine called <hi>Celindo,</hi> and my ſelfe, were brought vp without knowledge of father, though ſince we receiued the order of armes, we haue met with certaine tokens to be children vnto the prince <hi>Meridian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Excéeding ioy conceiued the Quéen, of the Ladies company, reſoluing to enioy it ſo long as ſhe would. They vowed firme amitie, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the peace was of no ſmall effect: for this Lady was of higheſt eſtimation among the Pagans, in the Grecian warres. By little and little being tender of yeares, and knowing that the manifeſting of their loues, was ſome eaſe to their borthering cares, either vnderſtood who was the Louer to the other. Vppon which occaſion <hi>Floraliza</hi> thus ſaide.</p>
               <p>So that our fortune doth permit (moſt Péereleſſe Princeſſe) the Gréeke Princes to tryumph ouer our hearts. Séeing the heauens will haue it ſo (excellent Lady aunſwered the Quéene) and ſo haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured them from their birthes, we cannot but acknowledge their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie, ſpecially the <hi>Tynacrian</hi> Prince, knowing how great his gaines are, thus being loued. To which <hi>Floraliza</hi> made aunſwere.</p>
               <p>Stay my good Quéene: how well (by knowing your ſelfe to be loued) doo you iudge a ſtraungers diſtreſſe? who would not liue contented in middeſt of the greateſt euill, were wée certaine of that aſſurance?

Let it not ſo gréeue you bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Floraliza</hi> (ſaid the Quéene) that the knight of the Braunch doo wander in abſence of your preſence, ſo we diſtruſt not of his loue: And you doo not well to condemne him of ingratitude: for ile pawne my word vnto you, vowing by my high thoughts, to procure with all my power your chéefeſt ioy: for it were iniuſtice, another ſhould call him hers, you being alone in the world that deſerue him.</p>

Along a broade and beaten pathe trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both theſe Princes of bewtie, and <hi>Bellonas</hi> in valour.</p>
               <p>They had not gone ſcarce a mile, when they eſpied thrée knights of gallant diſpoſition: and well mounted, comming the ſame way: a croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13978:40"/>
the ſame lane iſſued an other: then whom the Ladies had not ſéene many of more liberal and brauer carriage: his deuice and armes were diſcribed at the Tryumphes in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for this was <hi>Don Clariſel</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria, Floralizas</hi> great Louer. Well did the Lady know him, and although the faith he ſhewed her, could no whit withdraw her affection from the <hi>Tynacrian:</hi> Neuertheleſſe, it pleaſed her to giue him that content that Ladies vſe to yéeld in pleaſant chat, reſeruing the beſt for their ſoules beloued. She tolde the Quéene, how ſhee knewe that Knight, but it behooued her to bee then concealed, for that ſhe told her.</p>
               <p>At length they all met, and none of them but inceſſantly gazed on both the Ladies. None of the thrée Knights were ſo courteous as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Prince, and ſo the one ſaid. It were ſome caſe (Sir knights) for one to ride while the other went on foot, and ſo by turnes to vſe your horſe. Becauſe we will not trouble our ſelues (anſwered <hi>Floraliza</hi>) to mount and diſmount ſo often, we haue choſen thus to trauell togither, vntill by ſome good chance we get an other horſe. This countrey doth yéeld ſo fewe (ſaid he) Sir knight, that I feare it will be very hard to get one. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, I had rather haue my hopes (replied the lady) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy vnciuill anſwere: whereto the knight ſaid. What, comming on foot and with ſuch little ſhew of valour, dare you make comparatiues with my words? which were you better mounted then I am, I would not ſuffer, eſpecially comming as you doo.</p>
               <p>There is no fault (ſaid the Lady) but may bee found in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous knight, and therefore, hauing committed this, there is no doubt but you haue all the reſt: yet if you will try your much ſtrength with mine, I am content to doo it: conditionally, that he which ſhall forgoe his ſaddle, looſe his horſe and armour. Had you a horſe (ſaid the knight) I would not much care to doo it, were it but to diſburthen you of your armed loade: which now in hotte weather will be ſurely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.</p>
               <p>Let not that gréeue you (ſaid ſhee) for my companion will lend me his horſe, and be content to looſe him, if you ouerthrowe me. Eare he could anſwere, with ſuch grace ſhe leapt into the ſaddle, that the Quéen and Prince were amazed, and brandiſhing her Lance, ſhe went towards the knight, ſaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:41"/>Go too, diſcourteous knight, now is the time to trie whether of the two can better kéepe his armor. Forced through the challenge hée had made, and the preſence of his companions, he turned about his great horſe, which was the laſt he did in all his life. For meeting, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Ladie receiued a ſtrong incounter, hers was ſuch, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king three parts of the lance appeare at his backe, at one inſtant, he loſt horſe, armour, and life.</p>
               <p>No longer ſtayed the other two, ſéeing their friend ſlaine, but ranne againſt the Ladie, no more ſtirring her, then if they had run againſt a rocke. The Quéen was abaſhed, ſeeing how baſely the Knights beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues, ſo drawing foorth her good ſword, at two ſteps ſhee was where <hi>Floraliza</hi> ſtood, with <hi>Camillas</hi> in her hand. The Quéen entred ſidelong with her ſword aloft, which valiantly diſcharging on the Knights helm, ſhe ſtrooke him from his horſe, and with another, on the ground ended his life: which done, quickly mounted his horſe, confounding the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> with admiration, who turning about, ſawe the Ladie beate the other Knight vnto the earth, with a moſt pitteous wound: whoſe paine, ere it left him, left him lifeleſſe. The Quéene went to her, and laughing ſaid. In faith (ſir Knight) wee haue now horſes for Pages, had we brought any, if they were on foote, &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting armour, here we want no choiſe.</p>
               <p>A greater puniſhment then this (ſaid <hi>Floraliza</hi>) deſerued their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie: and turning to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> thus ſpake. Haue you any néed (ſir Knight) of our helpes, for ſince we haue got horſes, a little haſte elſe calles vs away. By the voyce he ſéemed to know her, whoſe figure he had impreſſed in his heart, and ſo in ſome amazement did replie. Not at this time (ſir Knight) more then comming in time, that I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the ſight of your high déed, I would not looſe the conceiued content of gazing on them, eſpecially being atchiued by whom deſerues the honour of euery victorie. So fearing the Prince had knowne, or that by longer conuerſation ſhe might be diſcouered, ſhe tooke leaue of him, and with the Quéene entred into a thicket adioyning, to reſt, not of the battell toyle, but of the ſeas wearineſſe. They allighted, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their horſes féed on the graſſe, where ſhee recounted who <hi>Don Clariſell</hi> was, and how ſincerely he publiſhed himſelfe to bee her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and how vnknowne to either, they were brought vp in one wood. She did recite the aduentures with ſuch paſſion, that the Quéene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

he ſhould certainly marry her.</p>
               <p>In many diuers matters did the two Ladies chat away the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, leauing vntil the next day their approach vnto the great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie of <hi>Tynacria,</hi> where ſo many aduentures happened vnto the mightie Emperour <hi>Trebatio.</hi> It greatly pleaſed <hi>Floraliza</hi> to tread on the ſoyle of her deare knight, hartily beſéeching the immortal Gods, to graunt her no other end of her deſires then her faith deſerued, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe ſought him: for ſhe neuer imagined any thing, but what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed loue, to loue him, and with vnfained conſtancy harbouring his affaires in the midſt or her heart, tranſferring them from thence vnto the ſoule, to giue them there a place more quiet, frée from the worlds perturbations, and fortunes aſſaulting ſtormes: and where ſhe might better contemplate her happineſſe, being the <hi>Tynacrians</hi> Maiſters.</p>
               <p>They ſcruple of that litle they had from the Barke brought, with more content in being there purſuing their Louers, then were they in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> féeding on the daintieſt cates of the Emperors Court. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done, they a while diſcourſed of their knights, thinking that time loſt wherein they did not remember them. The houre of reſt being come, the tender Ladies made their blanckets of their beds, the earth, and for pillowes tooke their Helmes, and not without ſome teares to ſée themſelues in that manner, and vncertaine whether their toyle would auaile them. She that ſlept leaſt, not for louing moſt, but fearing her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections zeale would not bee accepted, was the Emperour <hi>Alicandros</hi> Néece, that about midnight vnclaſping the booke of her ſecret thoughts, ſhe found it ſo full of amorous arguments, grounded on deare experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it cauſed in her a newe griefe: which tormenting her with ſome extraordinary paſſion, to giue it paſſage ſhe ſat her vnder a loftie Pyne, where ſuppoſing the Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi> was not awake, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with more melodious harmony (then his, that deſcended into the vawtes of hell, among thoſe blacke inhabitants, to fetch his deare wife) to ſing theſe verſes.</p>

               <p>With many Millions of ſighs ſhe ended. The ſwéete melodie awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the faire <hi>Archiſilora,</hi> ioying to ſée her ſo firme a Louer. Long did they not continue thus, by reaſon that from the fartheſt ſide of the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, they heard the trampling of many horſes, and now &amp; then, the cries of outraged Ladies, by violence oppreſt. A little thing was inough to moue them, being naturally bold, togither they roſe &amp; bridled their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſwifter then the wind they ſpurd after the noyſe. In ſuch haſte went they, that though they quickly got into the high way, yet could they not know the cauſe. They durſt not ſunder themſelues for feare of looſing, but rather referring their affaires to Fortunes diſpoſe, they followed along that way which was moſt beaten with horſes hoofes: Two myles they gallopt not finding what they deſired, til with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſuns vpriſe, in a large faire plain they deſcried ſome 40. knights, and 3. Gyants, that guarded a waggon drawne with 4. horſes. Aſſured to haue found what they ſought, they let goe their Courſers reignes, with more fierceneſſe then <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf. Neuer was ſuch boldnes ſéen, for the knights were mightie, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enterpriſe choſen, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giants euery one an <hi>Hercules.</hi> Neuertheles, the royall Ladies nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fearful aſſault, with their ſwords in hand, entred among thoſe knights, as the hungry Lyon enters a heard of harmeleſſe ſhéep, to ſéek his praie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:42"/>Againſt the Ladies ſtrength, their aduerſaries ſtéele doubled ſhéelds nor fine tempored armor was no defence: for their valor and puiſſance was infinit, and the deſire they had to frée the priſoners, made them with more force flooriſh their ſwords among them. Ere they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, eight of their fellowes were ſlaine, and the reſt ſtrooke the Ladies with many encounters: but their Armor was ſuch, as they ſuffered no impreſſion. So the furie of their Launces being paſt, Oh <hi>Archyſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who would not admire thée, ſéeing thée raiſed on thy ſtyrrops, the ſhéelde at thy backe, and with thy ſword betwixt both thy hands, range among thoſe knights, giuing no blowe, but was deadly, or deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? At her héeles followed the Sythian Matrone, that no leſſe then ſhe made her ſelfe feared with <hi>Camillas</hi> blade, whoſe edge euen to the bone pierced their armor. It ſéemed they both ſtriued to excéed the other in déeds, almoſt impoſſible in humane ſight.</p>
               <p>Abaſhed were the Gyants togither with a bigge Knight that was Lord of them all, to ſée how two knights hazarded their pryze, with ſo much labour obtained: to be rid of them two Gyants, with croes of Iron made towards them, crying to their knights: Away, away, you cowards, for ſhame bluſh to ſée two Knights thus vſed. Neuer were they by them obeyed more willingly then then: for with the word they withheld their ſwords, accounting that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand their liues, which figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the two, they aduentured on the dyce. The two mightie Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants on their ſtyrrops ſtretcht themſelues, and ſhaking their armes, threw the croes more fiercer then were they hurried from a Cannons mouth. Carfully did the two Ladies (ſéeing how it concerned them) expectit, that ſpurring their horſes, gaue way vnto the Iauelings, and ioyning ſo neare their Maiſters, that ere they drew their Comitors, they made them féele the waight of their armes. So eager was <hi>Meridians</hi> daughters aſſault, that ſhe loſt the ſtrength of her blowe, yet was it ſuch, that falling on his Beuer it dazelled his ſight, and wounded him at large on the fronte, from whence the bloud iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, and dropping in his eyes, blinded him, to the Ladies great aduantage. Forward ſhe paſt, ſwifter then lightning, and with the ſame ſhe turned: at ſuch time that the Gyant did ſo, as furious as a bayted Bull, with his Fawchon rayſed againſt her, that he wounded him, and at once on either diſcharged the furie of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:43"/>A thouſand ſtarres ſaw the Lady within her rich helme, but the Giants was filled with blood, for the thin edged ſword on the head, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him dangerouſly. This while was not the Quéene idle, for in her aſſault ſhe had brauely done he part: and being longer winded, and more vſed to the warre then <hi>Floraliza,</hi> with <hi>Mars</hi> his ſtrength, ſhe laid him on the ſide of his helme, diſarming all that part, and on the head gaue him a mightie wound, cutting away a péece of the ſkull, and the blade diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe the ſhoulder, with like furie, as the roaring waters runne through a lockt riuer, it ſtrooke away all his Vanbrace, and with it cut all the laces off his ſhield, and made him ſhake like a loftie Pyne: ſtrooke with an other blaſt, ſhe gaue her horſe the reignes, and quickly turned him before the Gyant, ſetled himſelfe, ſhee let flie at his wounded arme.</p>
               <p>This blowe aſſured her the victorie, for lighting on the vnarmed place, ſhe threw it to the ground, and made him roare horribly: for the wound was mortall. Without payment ſcaped not the Quéene, for ere his ſoule departed, diſpairing of life, ſo mightie a blowe hee diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed on her head, that ſhe fell vpon her horſe, voyding much blood from her mouth: with ſuch ſtrength was it executed, that finding no other ſtay, it drew the Gyant after it, who like a Tower ouerturned with a whirle winde, he fell downe.</p>
               <p>Long in accompanying him was not the other, for <hi>Floraliza</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying what the Quéene had done, ſo vehemently purſued her Combat, that ſhe tumbled the Gyant at her horſes féete, with ſo many deadly wounds, that he ſtraight gaue his ſoule vnto the diuell, that long ſince had expected it.</p>
               <p>No longer ſtay made the other Gyant and knight, but with their Courſers faſteſt running, prickt againſt the Ladies, to ſurpriſe them vnawares. Dangerous were not the encounters, by reaſon of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted armor, though they were extreame greeuous. Betwéene the foure, they began one of the braueſt battels on the earth. But at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it was diſordered: for the knights not reſpecting their honors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither ſtept to aide their maiſters: in no little danger were the ladies, ſéeing themſelues aſſaulted ſo many waies: but fetching ſtrength and courage from their amorous breaſts, they inacted déeds impoſſible to <hi>Mars</hi> his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:43"/>He that moſt vext them was the great Knight, being one of the ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in all <hi>Paganiſme.</hi> With him the faire Quéene made her battell, thinking by that meanes the victorie was ſureſt. Shee left the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Floraliza</hi> with the Gyant, and ſome twentie Knights that were left, but ſo wounded, that ſhe quickly brought them to twelue. They were all buſied in thoſe bloodie affaires, when the braue <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> like a thunderbolte galloped along that field towards them: who alſo had heard the Ladies outcries in the Chariot, and haſting to helpe them, had loſt himſelfe in the wood, notwithſtanding he came in good time, amazed to ſée ſo many dead.</p>
               <p>He knew the Knights, and they him: he entred with his lance aboue hand: a better blowe was not executed in that battell, for approaching the place where his Ladle fought, ſtrongly brandiſhing, he threwe it at the Gyant, which penetrating all his ſtéeles places, it appeared at his backe, the pike bloodie with his hearts gore. This blowe was to no ſmall purpoſe, for it mooued a ſuddain ſtrange alteration in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies breaſt, iudging ſo well of him that gaue it, that ouer ioyed with that content, ſhe ſaid to her ſelfe. Oh moſt heroicke Knight, would I might ſatiſfie thy deſires, and not wrong the <hi>Tynacririan.</hi> There ſtayed not the galliant <hi>Don Clariſell,</hi> for drawing foorth <hi>Mylos</hi> furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſword, he gaue no blowe, but ouerthrew an enemie dead: cloſe by them went the Ladie, excéeding glad to ſée him. On horſebacke was the Prince, one of the greateſt Knights in the world, and ſo rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed, no heart could deſire more. For all this, ceaſed not the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Lirian Matrone</hi> to purſue the great Knight, entring, and retiring with ſuch agillitie, as <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe, were hee there, could wiſh no more.</p>
               <p>In his countrie was the Pagan accounted the valianteſt knowne, wherefore he brauely held out in fight. Of all helpes néeded he, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batting with the Quéene, both in beautie, and in valour, who flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing her weapon, ſtept in with one foote forward, and lay open, that the Pagan might enter: who being excéeding ſkilfull, perceiued her intent, and making her looſe two blowes, gaue her two thruſts one after another, which forced her to bow backwards on her horſe: as ſhe raiſed her ſelfe, with all poſſible ſpéede hee ſtrooke her on her rich helme, but reacht her onely with the poynt, wherefore the blowe was not to much purpoſe, though it gréeued her much.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:45"/>No <hi>Hircanian</hi> Tyger was now comparable to the Quéene in fury, to ſée her ſelfe ſo vſed, ſhe floriſhed her ſword, and let it fall ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his head, that it felde him along the ſaddle, ſorely wounded. She truſted to the ſtrength of her Horſe, ſo giuing him the ſpurres, ranne againſt her enemy, incountring him ſo ſtrongly with his breaſt, that ſhée ouerthrew them both to the ground.</p>
               <p>But the Pagan knowing his diſgrace, leapt aſide, and though weake and with many wounds, ſetled himſelfe to make his defence againſt the Quéene, that nimbler then an Eagle, leapt from her horſe after her pray. Deadly wounded was the Pagan, and no maruell then, if with euery blowe ſhe make him kiſſe the earth with his handes and knées.</p>
               <p>Alreadie were the Louers (though different in affection) rid of all their enemies, and were ſet to gaze on the battell, when from the top of the mountaine deſcended a Knight with more brauery then the ſun. Farefull it was to heare the trampling noyſe of his neighing Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, whereſoeuer he trod. He arriued at the chaire, extreamly abaſhed to ſée all his haſt had not auailde him. Oh cowardly Prince (ſaid hée) is it poſſible thou haſt ſhewen thy ſelfe ſlow in thy Ladies ſeruice? thou doeſt wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully call thy ſelfe hers, being the leaſt in ayding her in her greateſt diſtreſſe. There was hee interrupted, hearing a horrible blowe: which was thus, The Quéen noting they all looked on her, iudged it weakneſſe longer to continue, and therefore ſtrongly ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her ſelfe on her left foote, with both hands laid on the Pagans broken helme ſuch a blow, that diuiding his head downe to the neck, at one inſtant ſhe ended both his loues and life. And as if ſhe had done nothing, mounted into her ſeate, and turned about to thanke the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> for his good helpe: whereto he anſwered. All, and more then this is due to your valour, (moſt excellent Knight) for where yours and this Knights is, little auailes mine. So thence they went to ſpeak vnto the Ladies in the Chariot, which were <hi>Garrofilea,</hi> and her bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious daughter <hi>Roſaluyra,</hi> with two other damzels their attendants, whoſe beautie made our two Ladies ſomwhat enuie them. Neuer did any Knight affect with more reaſon, <hi>Lindoriano</hi> Prince of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> who was new come. Well did mother and daughter knowe him, and none like him had the Princeſſe eſtéemed. From the heauens may you receiue your deſerued recompence (moſt mightie knights) for the

ſuccour you lent me and my daughter (ſaid the cruell <hi>Garrofilea:</hi>) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though conſidering the dutie by your ſelues due to the valour of your owne perſons, in diſcharging it, ſo the immortall powers long ſince guerdoned it, by imparting ſo largely their matchleſſe gifts with you, making you abſolute in all compleate vertues: yet that our ioy may be repleat, and we know to whom we reſt bound, we ſhall account it an exceeding fauor, and remaine debtors togither with the former for the ſame, if you will relate your names and ſtates vnto vs. To which, <hi>Archiſilora</hi> replied. In more then this (ſoueraigne Quéen) doth this Knight and my ſelfe deſire to fulfill your will. This Knight, poynting at <hi>Floraliza,</hi> is called the Knight of <hi>Hope:</hi> and my ſelfe, of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flames of <hi>Loue:</hi> we came togither, and therefore know wee not him, to whom we are all ſo much indebted. Yet more then this muſt you do at our intreaties, (ſaid the beautious <hi>Roſaluira</hi>) and for my ſake vnlace your helmes, vnleſſe you will cancell the bonds of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted loue. There is none but trembles at that word (diuine Ladie) and feares it will bee ſo (aunſwered the Qeéene) and therefore for ſo much as it toucheth me, I wil looſe no fauor I may therby reap. Who ſhall dare do otherwiſe (ſaid <hi>Floraliza</hi>) excéeding ioyfull thereat, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhe ſpake with her <hi>Tynacrian.</hi> At once they put off their helms, and being ſomewhat heated by the battell, there is no beautie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the two Ladies. Oh Prince of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> oh thou haſt a heart of ſtéele to reſiſt this blowe! Many daies it was ſince hee ſawe her, yet preſently he acknowledged her to bee the ſoueraigne of his ſoule. Haue patience magnanimous Louer, for gainſt loues accidents there is no better ſhield. So like was the Qu. of <hi>Lyra</hi> vnto the Prince <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphebo,</hi> that <hi>Garrofileo</hi> aſſuredly thought ſhee had her ſonne before her, ſhe leapt out of the Chariot with an extazie of ioy, and embracing the Quéene, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Oh my deare ſon <hi>Polliphebo,</hi> may it bee thou ſhouldeſt thus long be abſent, and not aduertiſe me of thy aduentures and happie ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; crueltie more then inhumane it hath béen, and were you not ſon to ſuch a father, I could not beléeue it of any, but knowing whoſe you be, I am aſſured of your naturall crueltie, which makes mee reſemble your tyrannous father. The Quéen did ſtraight perceiue <hi>Garroſileas</hi> deceit, and by her words confirmed the report blazoned of her rigors, ſhe told her of it, &amp; who ſhe was, which not a little admired the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and alſo when they knew her companion to be a Ladie, a newe the Quéen imbraced them, ſaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:46"/>Pardon (ſoueraigne Ladie) my bolde intreatie, for iudging you to bée the Prince <hi>Polliphebo</hi> my ſonne, hath made me commit this fault.

               <p>By this the faithfull Earle of <hi>Modica</hi> was arriued with aboue thrée hundreth Knights, and the Ladies vnwilling to be ſtayed, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued leaue to depart. You will not I am ſure ſo wrong vs (ſaide the Queene) as to leaue vs abſent of your company. We can do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (imperious Dame) ſaid <hi>Floraliza,</hi> for the good ſucceſſe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture this Lady and I haue in hand, conſiſteth in briefe expedition. If it be ſo (heroicke Ladies) and leaſt you ſhould looſe that happie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, I am content to looſe the great content I ſhould reape by your conuerſation: wherevppon they kindly embraced and departed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in <hi>Tynacria</hi> eternal memorie of their beautie and brauery. And whileſt <hi>Lindariano</hi> made his excuſe, crauing pardon for his ſtay: the beauteous <hi>Floraliza</hi> thus ſpake vnto <hi>Don Clariſell.</hi> Pardon mée (ſir Knight) for not doing this before, but let our lawfull and vnauoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded buſineſſe bee our ſufficient excuſe, although it néeds not be giuen to him, that may be aſſured all happie content is wiſht him. Words were theſe that gaue new life vnto the Louer, nouriſhing it many yeares with theſe words.</p>
               <p>The Prince taking her by the hand, ſaide. You haue done mee mightie wrong (moſt ſacred Lady) to intreat him with theſe wordes, that onely deſires to liue perpetually at your obedience. The Lady drewe away her hands, not ſuffering him to kiſſe them, but caſting her armes about his neck, ſaid. He that hath ſhewed his to be ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie (heroicke Knight) is iniuried to haue mine, but his rather are to be requeſted for that ſacrifice. And inquiring for <hi>Forſiana</hi> and <hi>Don Argante</hi> of <hi>Phenicia</hi> (for they all loued one another like brothers) ſhe tooke her leaue of him, refuſing his companle, which with his ſoule he offered, alleadging how it behooued them to go alone. And as one that with admiration gazeth on the ſplendor of the heauenly Sunne, with his radiant beames illuminating the earth, and on a ſuddaine ſées it daſht with myſtie vapors of a blacke clowde, wherewith his light being obſcured, blinds and bereaues the poore beholders of his contented ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:46"/>Euen ſo thought the Princely Louer he was left, though glad to ſée how gently his gentle Lady intreated him. Towardes the ſea did the Ladies take their iourney, where they found two Barkes without any to guide them. It was admirable, for ſo ſoone as the Quéene entred in the one to helpe the Lady in, ſo ſwift flies not the arrow looſed from a ſtéele bow, as of it ſelfe it lancht into the déepe. In a minute it vaniſht out of ſight, leauing faire <hi>Floraliza</hi> ſo extreame ſorrie, that ſhe was about to fling her ſelfe into the ſea, conſidering what ſhe had loſt. What content canſt thou hereafter hope for poore Ladie (ſaid the afflicted Dame) being robbed of that good the heauens had imparted thée with her companie? What mayeſt thou account happie, hauing loſt her ſwéete comfortable conuerſation? Oh fortune, wouldſt thou but waigh how little ſtrength I haue left mee by thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant changes, thou wouldſt among ſo many infortunate happes, mingle one fained pleaſure.</p>
               <p>She ſhipt her horſe in the other barke, and waighing the anchors that held it to the ſhore, lying along vpon the hatches of the ſame, ſhée committed his gouernment to <hi>Neptunes</hi> mercie. Yet it was not ſo ill looked too, but the enuious <hi>Lupercio</hi> had taken charge of it, who by all poſſible meanes aſſembled all the mightieſt knights in the Hauen of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> to tranſport them thence vnto the maruellous Tower: for he had alreadie knowne, there ſhould bee a knight would win <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> armor, and his battell-axe, wherewith the inchauntment ſhould be ended: and knowing he was an enemie procured to get and bring theſe ſo valiant Knights on his ſide, and therefore did he guide <hi>Flora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizas</hi> Barke, who on the fourth day of her Nauigation, met with her brother <hi>Don Cellindo,</hi> with whom ſhe fought a moſt cruell combat, which for breuity is not recited: but being known for her brother, he en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred into her Bark, and were directed towards <hi>Nyquea,</hi> méeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually all their voyage on the ſeas, infinit Galleis and ſhippes, as well Chriſtians as Pagans: where beeing arriued, wee muſt leaue them a while, to remember <hi>Roſabell,</hi> whom we haue long wronged with forgetfulneſſe.</p>

For none other (ſir knight) replied the Damzell, but to ſee one of the faireſt Ladies in the greateſt daunger in the world, and knowing that onely in your preſence reſts her remedie: and in the leaſt delay, the greateſt death that euer befell to any, is ſure on her. For know (moſt valiant Knight) that in the kingdome of <hi>Tentoria,</hi> there is a Lady no leſſe beautifull, then ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all good quallities and graces of the minde. Shee was and is beloued of all her ſubiects, becauſe they know that chaſtitie &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie holds in her one equall degrée of ſoueraigntie. Through the onely fame of her perfections, with her the mightie <hi>Dardario</hi> fell in loue, who was ſaid to be the valianteſt Gyant in the vniuerſe. Hee with a puiſſant hoaſt came vnto her land, though peaceably: with him hee brought a ſonne vnknighted, for his yeares did not allow it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came farre mightier then his father. He ſent his Ambaſſadors to our Quéene, to let her know of his comming and demaund, which was to marrie her.</p>
               <p>A thouſand times was my Lady about to ſtay her ſelfe, to auoyde a match ſo vnequall. She called a Councell of her Nobilitie: who reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to withſtand him with fierce warre, by reaſon there were many valiant knights that would looſe their liues to defend their Quéen and countries ſafetie: for although they ſawe the Gyant come with ſignes of peace, yet doubttng the woorſt, had gathered a great armie of men, becauſe they would not be ſuddainly ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:47"/>There were many voyces among them, that the Quéen ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him, being Lord of al the Iſles in the <hi>Adriaticke</hi> Sea. But in the ende, moſt part agréed, they ſhould rather die with honour in fielde, then for feare ſuffer ſuch a marriage. Eight daies reſpite had the Gyants giuen them for their aunſwere. In which time the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Syrinda</hi> commending her affaires vnto the Gods, and her wit, ſhe reſolued on the greateſt déed that euer Ladie did imagine. Shee acquainted it with her Captaines and Councell of warre, which are the ſhiefeſt Lords in her land: and this it was. That ſhe would ſéeme to conſent to his deſire, and that ſhe durſt vndertake in the night of her wedding day, to giue the Gyants head vnto her Knights, who ſhould be in readineſſe to iſſue vpon their enemies, whoſe vanquiſhment would be eaſie, being with the Feaſts careleſſe and vnarmed. Almoſt all the Councell approoued my Ladies deuiſe, and praying the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods to giue her good ſucceſſe therein, they aduertiſed the Gyants thereof, that with extreame ioy was almoſt beſides himſelfe. All his ſubiects laying by their armes, with gallant ſhewes welcommed her anſwere. Two daies after, the proude <hi>Dardaria</hi> entred the Cittie with his ſoonne <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> whom hee begot on a ſtrong Gyanteſſe, and ſo iſſued like his Parents. He onely carried his bigge Cemitor at his ſide, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with two Knights richly adorned, and himſelf in robes of ineſtimable valor, with a triple crowne on his head, woorth a kingdome, with Princely brauerie was he entertained by the diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Syrinda,</hi> whom the fierce pagan imbraced with the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the world, thinking himſelfe in heauen, ſéeing the Ladies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding beautie: who with a thouſand fained loue toyes inueigled the diſarmed Gyant.</p>
               <p>The deſired night being come, which was eternall to the Pagan, and ſupper ended, hee was moſt ſumptuouſly brought to his bedde: where the Lady faining ſome modeſt ſhame to be ſéene naked, ſo long deferred her going to bedde, that the force of the many meates and wine, forced him into a ſound ſléepe. Hee neuer more awaked: for the Lady ſeeing her aduantage, drew foorth a ſharpe two edged Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which ſhe thrice ſtabbed in his brutiſh breaſt, pearcing his heart therewith. Now that the couragious Dame was aſſured of his death, ſhe brauely cut off his head, and preſently gaue it to thoſe knights ſhée had appoynted to expect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:48"/>They tooke it, extreamely ouerioyed, and conueyed the Quéene and Ladies out of the Pallace, for feare of ſome danger that might happen the next day. With great deſire they expected his comming, whereon ſcarce had the Sunne ſent foorth his meſſengers of morne, when an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme was ſounded through all the Citie: they of the Campe without, thinking it was in honour of the Nuptialls, replyed with all their mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Inſtruments. In an inſtant were aboue fiftie thouſand men Armed, whereof fiue thouſand aſſaulted the Pallace, leauing none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue that with <hi>Dardario</hi> came, except his haughtie ſonne, that hearing the noyſe, ranne foorth with one of the bedde poſtes, making ſuch pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſlaughter that none durſt aſſault him. He got ſome weapons of thoſe that were ſlaine, wherewith his déeds are incredible. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, and by ſo many thouſands aſſaulted, his death was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: which the ſturdie youth perceiuing, got vnto the Camp: where being come, he found it ſo diſordered and ſo many ſayle, and the reſt ſo affrighted, that he could ſcant méete with any that might tell him the cauſe of ſo great euil: in the ende hee came to knowe it with ſuch great griefe, as he was about to kil himſelfe: his fathers Armour he put on, and the firſt he met guirded him his ſword. The fury that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the youth when he ſawe his fathers head pearched on a pole vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the higheſt Turret of the Citie, cannot moſt (valiant Knight) be credited. Hée went foorth into the fielde roaring like a Bull, and killing without mercy: but his force was to ſmall purpoſe, for all his Army was diſcomfited, and the Quéenes ſubiects behaued themſelues ſo well, that ere the day was halfe ſpent, they had put the better thrée parts of their foes to the ſword, and gaue chaſe to the reſt euen to their ſhippes, wherein ſore wounded, as many as could imbarke themſelues, and among them the mightie <hi>Abſtrutio,</hi> purpoſing with newe powers to returne, and with fire and ſword to deſtroy our kingdome. In his he arriued, where his intent he preſently put in execution, not without griefe, to ſée that of fortie thouſande men his father had carried with him, he had returned backe againe ſcarce fiue thouſand. The Paganne ſpoyles left all our lande excéeding rich: and our Quéene with the greateſt Honour that euer Lady ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Notwithſtanding the great tryumphes made for ſo happie victorie, yet would they not liue careleſſe of their ſafetie: but euery day muſtred &amp; trained their ſouldiers, and ſtrengthning all their garriſons
<pb facs="tcp:13978:48"/>
with the beſt men in the land, becauſe they would not looſe what was obtained for want of diiſſipline, béeing aſſured the ſonne would come to reuenge the fathers death: whoſe body was caſt out for foode vnto the byrdes and beaſts. But now (Magnanimious Knight) returning to our purpoſe, the murthered Gyant had in his owne Pallace my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies liuely counterfeite, which he had cauſed to be made, when hee firſt became enamoured of her.</p>
               <p>This being left at home, came to his ſonnes hands, which daily frequenting, and the helpe of his tender yeares, with continuall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the content, which to be beloued of ſo faire a Lady would yéelde: kindled ſuch a fire in his breaſt, that he could in nothing delight ſaue in contemplation of <hi>Syrindas</hi> bewtie, whoſe loue ſo oppreſt him, as it bereft him of his beſt ſences, and diminiſhed his health. He reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to paſſe vnto <hi>Tentoria,</hi> and colourably procure alone, what his father with ſo many men had miſt. He was not of ſhape and feature nothing ſo deformed as his Syre, but certainly farre ſtronger, and higher he is a handfull then any knight, being no Giant. Arriued in my Ladies countrey, he brought in his company eight Knights, his neare Allyes, of no leſſe force then himſelfe. Diſguiſed he entred the Citie, where the Quéene kept her Court, and knowing that ſhe vſed to walke abroade vnto a neare adioyning Groue, he watcht his time, and hauing opportunitie one day, followed her, tooke her, and ſetting her before him on his horſe, carried her away, not dooing nor offering her any diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, though ſhe had moſt cruelly ſlaine his father: he tolde her his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, deſiring her not to refuſe his marriage, ſince all the world knew how much it honoured her to doo it. Whereto ſhe aunſwered.</p>
               <p>If like a good Knight (moſt cruell <hi>Abſtruſio</hi>) thou haddeſt procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my good will, it had not bene much I had yéelded to thy requeſt: but ſince thou haſt imployed thy force vpon a poore weake Lady, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee my owne murtherer, then conſent to any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Why then (ſaid the louer) that thou mayeſt know what aſſured confidence you may repoſe on my ſtrength, and arme, Ile giue thée leaue for ſixe moneths ſpace to ſend and ſéeke about for that Knight, whoſe Fame aboue al others ſhal memoriſe his déeds, to be the greateſt with whom hand to hand Ile Combat about thée: proouing, that none but I merits thy bewtie: ſo that if I prooue Conqueror, thou take mee for thy huſband, with willing and blythe minde: but if I be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:49"/>
I vow and proteſt by all I may, to remit and releaſe any action I may pretend of marriage towards thée: for which cauſe, and that the battle may be effected, Ile ſet thée frée with all pleaſure to enioy thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and this becauſe thou ſhalt not doubt I wil deny the Combat, or violate my word. Somewhat pacified was the impriſoned Ladie hearing the Pagans offer, and conſidering that was her beſt, agreed thereto. Which gladded the Pagans verie ſoule, ſuppoſing himſelfe ſure of the Lady, thinking none able to take her by that meanes from him. While theſe things paſt, newes were thither brought of the neuer dying honor ye had obtained in the Iouſts of <hi>Grecia,</hi> ending them to your immortal glorie. Wherevpon my Ladie thought to none ſafer then to you, this dangerous aduenture could be recommended, becauſe the ſtrong <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> is the valianteſt in all thoſe parts. She put me in truſt with this buſineſſe, being from a childe brought vp in her ſeruice, which I promiſed to performe with all diligence: and either looſe my life, or let you knowe the neceſſitie wherein I left her, truſting that a knight ſo abſolute in all excellencies, would be pitiful, lending his help bound by lawes of knighthood, to a diſtreſſed Lady: and let not my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Gyants ſtrength, put any doubt in your vnconquered breſt: for hauing on your part the ſtrong ſhield of Iuſtice, it wil be ſufficient to giue you the eternal honor of ſo glorious a Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe braue knight, that hath from ſuch remoted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries brought me to ſéeke you, and conſider whether my iourney be not lawful, and your liberal offer iuſt. It is (kind damzel) and am much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyants tyrannie (ſaid the Prince) to force the Lady againſt her wil to marry him: and wold I were already with him, that (Lady) you might know your Quéenes remedie if it lie in me, is made voyde for want of power, and not wil to hazard my perſon in her ſeruice: and my life I wil aduenture in any danger, to right the wrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhe doth ſuſtaine. Why then braue knight (ſaid ſhe) I may goe merry, ſéeing you ſo willingly affected to my buſineſſe, and may the Goddes giue you the due merits your bounteous care deſerueth: and ſéeing that for my Lady you muſt vndertake ſuch a fight, ſhe ſends you Armor and Horſe conuenient to cope with ſuch an aduerſary. She drew forth the Armor which were indéed as ſhe ſaid, and excepting his of <hi>Hector,</hi> he neuer ſawe better: of colour they were purple, croſt with ſanguine barres, garniſhed with ſome flowers of rich gliſtring ſtones, which more adorned them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:49"/>The Gréeke put them on, which fitted him as they were made by his meaſure. On his ſhield was brauely figured the pictures of Iuſtice and Chaſtitie embracing, and ouer their heads this motto.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Vpon each other both relies,</l>
                  <l>(Twinnes) kil one, the other dies.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This deuice greatly pleaſed the Prince, becauſe it iumpt with his buſineſſe. With theſe armes was gallant <hi>Roſabel</hi> armed in, neither in theſe affaires nor the thought of his hoped battel, forgetting his <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> whoſe abſence not a litle gréeued him, for none had loſt ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in loue as he, with ſo many ſighes obtained, and ſo his ſorrow was tollerable, looſing ſo great good, for none will gréeue at a loſſe, if the cauſe be not reſpected. Not méeting any aduenture worthy memory, he arriued at the Ile wherereof <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> was King. Straight leapt he on ſhore, mounting a mightie roane courſer, which the néedy Dame had ſent him: then which he neuer beſtridde a better, his Bollador, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The Damozel maſked her ſelfe, for feare of being knowne by any of thoſe that brought her away, when the Princeſſe was ſtolen. They approched very neare the Citie, where the fierce king made his abode. It was admirable, chiefly the Caſtle, where the King kept his court, which ſéemed inexpugnable, both by nature and ſcituation of the place. About it, were many pleaſant Groues and Meades, where the Pagan often recreated himſelfe with <hi>Syrinda</hi> who by continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing with the Pagan, his valour and gallant diſpoſition, had excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly mollified her obduracy. And <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> ſaith ſhee, had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelfe for ſending her damozel to ſéeke any by force to plead her cauſe, being to her honor to take him for her huſband, that was able to protect both kingdomes, that vnited was one of the mightieſt in the world. The like imagination had ſtirred the Gréekes thoghts, thinking that he being ſo far different from the condition of others, his marriage much aduanced her. On this conſidered he, along the Chriſtal Current of a bubling ſtreame, when the mightie <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> walked on the other ſide, armed in ſtrong plates of ſtéele, bare headed without helme, to take the cooleneſſe of the freſh ayre: onely two knights without armor, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, bearing his: who was horſed on a furious Courſer, his ſight greatly pleaſed the Prince, for his damozel knowing him, told it <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:50"/>At his right hand rode the beautious <hi>Syrinda,</hi> on a milke-white Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey: ſhe was gallantly attyred, for being well intreated by the king, ſhe by dooing the like, did more allure him, and he loſt nothing by vſing her in that manner, forcing her to doo nothing againſt her will, which to his ſoueraigne gentleneſſe, may be attributed. Comming more neare the Lady, knew the Armor and horſe which ſhe ſent vnto the Knight ſhuld combat for her. She was ſo amazed (though his diſpoſition greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented her) that the ſtoute Pagan noted it, and demaunding the cauſe, halfe trembling told it.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Iupiter</hi> (ſaid the Pagan) how doeſt thou ſhew thy immortall power to honour me, ſending him at ſuch time hither, whom I heartily expected? Now ſhal you ſée faire Lady, whether my valour deſerue not ſome eſtimation in thy breſt, beeing ſo neare to ſée it by experience. So daunted was the Lady, that ſhe could not anſwere, reuoluing many things in her thoughts againſt her ſelfe: for if ſhe ſhould ſtay the battel from procéeding, it were to diſhonour the knight, hauing ſent for him ſo far, onely to that: and if ſhe ſuffered it, then ſhe imagined ſhe wronged her Louer towards the Pagan: ſo that ſhe was ſet betwéen two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, altogither oppoſed againſt her happineſſe, and which ſhee might iudge the leaſt to lay hands on, ſhe knew not. The haſtie comming of the Gréeke ſuffered her not to chuſe, for croſſing the riuer ouer a bridge, brandiſhing his Launce, went towards the Louers that greatly admired his comely grace.</p>
               <p>The Pagan nothing doubting his hoped victorie, expected him in a faire plain, ioyning to a thicket of tall Pynes, called the Groue of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, for neuer any entred it, but found ſomething to try the valour of his perſon. The Gréeke being come to him raiſed his Beauer, and ſaluted him thus. God ſaue the valiant <hi>Abſtruſio:</hi> I thinke I ſhall not néede to relate the cauſe of my comming, becauſe it was with thy conſent: neuertheleſſe, if without battell thou wilt remit the ſute thou doeſt pretend, thou ſhalt obtaine a ſure vnconſtant friend: for I doubt not, but thou knoweſt how it ſtaines a Noble minde, by force to force a Ladies will, for it neither belongeth to a good knight nor a true Louer: yet for all this, if thou wilt inſiſt in thy enterpriſe, let vs no longer deferre the combat, which inſtantly to be done, will bee too too long.</p>
               <p>While he ſpake, the Pagan ſtedfaſtly gazed on him, and iudging
<pb facs="tcp:13978:50"/>
him of great ſtrength, becauſe his conſtitution was not much leſſe then his owne, and this imagination he confirmed, noting the libertie of his words, which he ſaid procéeded of valour, for others at his ſole ſight, were ready to tremble. So he anſwered. In faith (Syr knight) I ſée no reaſon but any thing ſhould be done to obtain your friendſhip, which oght not be litle eſtéemed by him that hath it. But you ſée if I leaue the battell, it redounds to my diſhonor: for it will be ſaid, I did it for feare, which could neuer yet be reported, ſince I knew what armor ment: ſo now to giue occaſion of ſuch ſpéech, he wil not permit that knowes the eſtimation of true honour, and how it ought to be embraced. So let our battle be preſently, although I aſſure you, more then this, I neuer doubted the ende of any: witneſſes we ſhall néed none, for my promiſe paſt to this faire Princeſſe ſhall be ſufficient. It is ſo (replyed the Gréek) for ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one muſt of neceſſitie ſacrifice his bloold in this field, let the ſuruiuer be Conqueror &amp; Iudge to carrie away the Lady. Who came to ſpeake vnto the knight, ſo amazed, that the Gréeke conceiued the cauſe, and quickly aſſured himſelfe thereof. It gladded him, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing if he vanquiſht, to marrie her to the Pagan. Defied eache other had theſe combatants, and ſought for a conuenient place to make the battell, when from the thicket iſſued a knight vpon a nimble Coueſer: he did no more but take viewe of the number that was there, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>Euery one noted him, and muſed what he intended by ſuch haſte. But the deſire the two had of their Combat, made them forget him. They turned their fierce horſes about, whoſe ſucceſſe an other Chapter muſt vnfold: for it deſerueth much more.</p>

               <p>VVIth a thouſand amorous doubtes, the bewteous <hi>Syrinda</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the two braue warriors encounters, greatly fearing the Gréeke, becauſe ſhe ſent for him, and the Pagans ſucceſſe, good or badde, ſhee felt in middeſt of her ſoule: and eythers blowes ſhee receiued on her breſt. So that deare (Ladies) neuer had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battants
<pb facs="tcp:13978:51"/>
a more ſuſpitious Iudge: becauſe ſhe through loue, pleades the merits of the one: and the Gréekes worthineſſe, the bountie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he vndertooke her cauſe, inforced her to defend him. Oh (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Damzels, Natures chéefeſt bewties) lend me ſome litle fauour, that I may woorthily relate the rareſt ſingle Combat fought vppon the earth: for the one is <hi>Roſabel,</hi> of whom the world alreadie trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: the other, the haughtie <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> mirror of the Pagan Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The nimble ſwiftneſſe of their horſes, was occaſion of their quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker méeting, making more noyſe in their carrier, then <hi>Vulcans</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fire ratling through the ſkies, renteth his paſſage, flaſhing among the darkened Clowdes. Big and knottie were their Launces, but incountring with their ſtéeled ſhields, they ſéemed of ſlender willowes: Whoſe ſhiuers mounted ſo high, that their ſight gaue notice of that Combat aboue the fourth ſpheare. Neither miſcarried by the ſhocke, though both warriours were aſſured of the others ſtrength. Amazed was the Pagan, ſéeing his aduerſary in his ſaddle, for in all his life til then, he neuer incountred any but he ouerthrew him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hard ground. The Greeke drew foorth the Troyan <hi>Hectors</hi> ſword, glad to ſée the Pagans valour. And flouriſhing it aloft with that celeritie he vſed in all his hattles, let flie at the Pagan: who turned to warde it, yet his diligence preuailed not, for he had not ſcarce offered his defence, when the ſkilful Gréeke redoubled the ſtrength of his proffered blowe, and brauely diſcharged it on his aduerſaries ſhielde, it bootes not to be of fine tempered ſtéele, for all it reached was throwne to the graſſy plaine. Sometimes would they proffer aduantages, as in a ſchoole of Fence is accuſtomed, which would redownd vnto the offerers diſaduantage, as now it befel the Gréek Prince. For ſpurring his horſe, he wold haue giuen the <hi>Sarracen</hi> another blow before he ſetled himſelfe: he did ſo, but the vnbrideled fury of the horſe, moſt fiercely ranne beyond the Pagan, whoſe courſe <hi>Roſabell</hi> on a ſudden ſtaying, the plaine being wet, his hinder féete ſlipt, ſo that both headlong ſtumbled downe. <hi>Galtenor</hi> ſaith the Gréeke, loſt not his ſaddle: but <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> affirmeth it: adding, that his fall was the cauſe he performed one of his vſual acts: for being on his féete, in a drie place he awaited.</p>
               <p>The Pagan comming, that eagerly ranne to ouerthrow him: his Horſe he would not kil, but méeting breſt with breſt, with no leſſe force then <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe, hée made both Maiſter and horſe recoyle
<pb facs="tcp:13978:51"/>
backe in ſuch a maze, that hee had time to follow the Pagan, and caſt his armes about him. He was ſo quicke in performing it, that he had almoſt pitcht the Gyant on his head. So <hi>Syrindas</hi> Louer fearing ſome euill ſucceſſe, was inforced to do the like, and ſhaking the ſtirropes from his féet, ſuffred the Greeke to pull him off: who ſo mightily ſnatcht him from his ſeate, that he tumbled him on the ground: but cloſer doth not the Iuie incompaſſe about a moſſe begrowne Tower, then the Pagan embraced the Brittanicke youth, ſo that both fell grouelling on the earth, where riſing, they beganne a moſt gallant wraſtle, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo many ſlights and trickes, that the God of battelles could no more deſire.</p>
               <p>And ſo their wraſtle falling out at the beginning of their fight, it longer continued, either procuring ſome aduantage to get ground of his aduerſarie. Neuer were they in more danger then now. Along while ſtriued they thus, till wearie of grappling, wreſting foorth their armes, flung themſelues ſtrongly the one from the other, with ſuch admiration of thoſe that beheld them, as they beléeued not what they ſaw. Highly did the Ladie eſtéeme the Gréeke, ſéeing him ſo brauely maintaine himſelfe againſt him that was famouſed to bee the valianteſt in all the <hi>Adriatricke</hi> Iles, who on his owne behalfe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſdoubted, iudging his aduerſitie the mightieſt in the world. Now kéepe they no order, nor nothing procure they more then death, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall honour by conqueſt of his aduerſarie. One of the worldes beſt ſwords was the Gréekes, being at <hi>Venus</hi> inſtant requeſt tempered for the <hi>Troian,</hi> wherefore he neuer ſtrooke blow but it fetcht blood, cut armor and fleſh. And he himſelfe receiued them nothing inferior, and though they drew blood through the defence of his armour and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet they bruſed his fleſh in gréeuous manner. The Pagan at this time aſſaulted his aduerſarie, thinking with that blow to aſſure the victorie. But <hi>Trebatios</hi> kinſman, that was in all things his ſuperior, by ſtepping aſide auoyded it, letting him fiercely paſſe on, ſo turning after him, the Gréeke diſcharged his rage on the others waſte, in two he had cleft him, had he giuen the blow with good ayme, yet it put the Pagan in great paine: who for all that, recouering himſelfe, at once confronted each other: moſt mightie were the blowes that fell on their helmes, either drew his ſword beſméered with the others blood, and with the force of the ſtroke they ſet their hands on the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:52"/>The Gréeke did firſt riſe, being longer winded, and ere his foe was ſetled in his broken ſhielde, he gaue him ſuch a blowe, that cutting a great péece off it, deſcended on the ſhoulder, where it lighted ſo heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his knées were forced to the ground: Cloſe he would, thinking to ouerthrow the Pagan. But this bolde attempt had like to haue coſt him his life: for the fierce <hi>Abſtrutio</hi> being verie nimble, and ſéeing him come vnaduiſedly, he ſet his ſword betwéene him, on which the Prince cunning, felt the point in his fleſhe, whereat ſtaying, he gaue back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, elſe it had pierced a paſſage for his life.</p>
               <p>Héere miſt he his good Armor, attributing the fights continuance vnto the want of them. He turned fiercer then a ſauadge Beare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pagan, who by that was on foote, laying on him ſo many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blowes, that quickly ſome aduantage was diſcerned on <hi>Roſabels</hi> ſide: but it was ſuch as often his aduerſary hazarded his hopes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: for the Pagan ſéeing how it concerned him, did from his wounds drawe ſtrength, both to defend and offend: which yet made the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of the battle ſéem doubtfull: wherin the warriors were eager and gréedie one of the others ouerthrowe, that they ſpied not till they were almoſt ſurpriſed, who iſſued out of the Groue: they were foure mightie deformed Gyants, with aboue an hundreth knights, who knowing the Pagan, purſued him for reuenge, by reaſon of their fathers death, by his, which they deferred til they might take him at ſome aduantage from his Court.</p>
               <p>Well did the haughtie Gréeke gueſſe at their intent, noting the manner of their comming: wherefore vſing his accuſtomed magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, ſaid to <hi>Abſtruſio.</hi> Leaue we our battle in this eſtate ſir knight, for I repoſe ſuch truſt in your perſon, as when farther occaſion ſhall permit, you wil ende it: and now procure we to defend the Princeſſe from theſe knights, whoſe haſtie comming ſéemes not for peace. It cannot be expreſt how the Princes words gladded the Pagan, who replied. Your pleaſure be fulfilled (Sir knight) for henceforth I yéeld to you the victorie of this battle, becauſe farre more your magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bountie deſerueth. So both recounted on their horſes. For the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants arriuall brake off their ſpéeches. The knights were attired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Parthian</hi> maner, with bowes and arrowes, which like a ſhower of raine they let flie at the two knights, who felt ſome of them in their fleſh through their armor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:52"/>To ſhunne this furie, the Lady was forced to leape from her Palfray, which ſhe had no ſooner done, but one of the Gyants with twentie Knights tooke her vp, and in great haſte ſpurred away. At the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries ſhe made, her Louer ſawe her, and conſidering his loſſe, looſing her, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Now (moſt haughtie Knight) muſt you extend the vtmoſt of your valour, againſt theſe vilde villaines, whileſt I purſue the robber of my ioy, for without her I deſire no life. Do ſo (braue Knight) replied the Gréeke, for it is reaſon you ſhould. And I by ſhedding my hearts deare blood, ſhall but ſatiſfie my bounden dutie due to the Lady. Away like the winde in ſwiftneſſe departed the Pagan, leauing <hi>Roſabell</hi> in the greateſt perill in the world: but he was borne to indure them, and incouraging himſelfe being alone, couragiouſly he thruſt his horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that treacherous people. Neuer did Reaper in Harueſt ſeaſon, with more deſire enter his ſharpe ſickle in the yallow ripe corne, then with furie <hi>Lyrianas</hi> Louer preſt among thoſe Knights, bereauing ſom of armes, ſome of liues, and others wounded to the death, ſome hée cleft downe right, and ſome hee parted at the waſte in two: thirtie Knights had the Gréeke ſlaine, and wounded many, ere any of the Gyants could at full giue him one blow; ſo at length one of them prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to him, egerly to execute his wrath: but in the incounter, he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe with death. For although he wounded the Gréeke on the ſhoulder, yet he not reſpecting the others blowes, he caſt his ſhield at his backe, and though vnaduiſedly he ſpurred againſt the Gyant with his ſword raiſed in both hands, it fell on his thicke helme, which vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt, it was with the head cleft in the middeſt to the necke, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him downe at his horſe féete.</p>
               <p>So great was the Ire that poſſeſt the Knights, ſéeing their Gyant ſlaine, that vnder him they ſlew the Gréekes horſe. Now hee was in no leſſe daunger then of his life: for being on foote, they all ranne to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturne him with their horſes: ſome defence found hee behinde the heape of dead Knights, which was nothing, had not fortune hither brought the <hi>Tynacrian Polliphebo,</hi> flower of Chiualrie: who hauing paſt many ſtorms in the ſeas, the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for eithers good, did caſt him on that ſhore, directing him thither at ſuch time as he might ſuccor his couſin, who like <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe behaued him, for hauing ſlaine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſuruiuing Gyants horſes, in the fall he tooke from him an
<pb facs="tcp:13978:53"/>
Iron Mace that hung at the ſaddle bowe, the which at that inſtant ſerued him better then his ſword, for with it hee reached more out at length. The <hi>Tynacrian</hi> bleſt himſelfe to ſée a knight of ſuch force: he iudged him to be a Gréeke, for in them conſiſted the worldes ſtrength: he ſaid neuer a word, but with his launce aboue hand, like a fierce co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met entred among them, killing aboue tenne before he brake it. Hee would néeds rid the Knight from the Gyant that remained on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe: ſo drawing foorth his ſword, went to him, and taking it twixt both handes, raiſed himſelfe on his ſtirropes, and finding the Gyant careleſſe of him, executed the braueſt blow that in all that day was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (for he diſcharged his ſword on his middle, higher hee could not reach) in ſo braue a manner, that from thence downward hee left on horſebacke, tumbling the other halfe at <hi>Roſabels</hi> féete, that with the noyſe of the fall turned about, and ſéeing a déed ſo extraordinarie, could not but a lowde ſay thus.</p>
               <p>Oh mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> what vnmatcht incomparable ſtrength is this? He looked on his deuiſe, yet knew it not, for he had neuer before ſeene it: but deſirous to let him ſée what he beléeued, ſtept with his left foote forward, cloſed with the Gyant that vnmercifully laide on him, and ſtrongly firming himſelfe on the ground, with both hands diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his ſword on his ſhoulder, which effected ſuch a blowe, as it was doubted whether of the two the God of warre inured: for all that part downe to his legges he cut away: and like an Eagle leapt on a horſe that was neare him.</p>
               <p>Neither of the kinſmen ſpake to the other, leauing it till better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunie, but thruſt themſelues among that miſerable rowte, &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued they were ſo fewe whereon to ſhewe their valour. In leſſe then an houre were the two warriours left alone, yet mought it well bee ſaid, in them conſiſted the moſt part of humane power. Togither they put off their helmes, diſcouering their beautie admired, able to haue ſlaine <hi>Apollos</hi> in his glorie.</p>
               <p>They were almoſt of one age, ſo <hi>Roſabell</hi> firſt ſpake: Moſt mightie knight, the beſt that euer mine eyes beheld, make me merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to know to whom I am bound for my life: for to your happie comming, when I accounted it loſt, muſt I attribute my now enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.

The ioy cannot be expreſſed, which <hi>Roſabell</hi> conceiued, ſéeing him whoſe fame had filled the earth with immortall honour. He embraced him with theſe words.</p>
               <p>In faith (heroicke Prince) I may hereafter thinke my ſelfe the happieſt knight aliue, throgh the knowledge of ſuch an vncle: for know (though my déeds deſerue it not) I am your couſin <hi>Roſabell,</hi> of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Roſicler,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Oliua,</hi> and he that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more deſired then to know you. With excéeding content the <hi>Tynacrian</hi> embraced him.</p>
               <p>Oh vnexpected happineſſe, is it poſſible ſuch goodneſſe was in a land ſo remote, reſerued for me? what may I hope for that will not befall me, ſince fortune hath ſo luckily begunne my good, acquainting mee with one of the puiſſant Emperour <hi>Trebatios</hi> kinſmen? I doo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (moſt excellent Prince) this day ſhall ſo be inpreſt within my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, that firſt euery vytall power ſhall abandon their naturall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ere I will forget the remembrance of this preſent content, cauſed by the knowledge of ſo warlike a couſin: &amp; be aſſured (deare <hi>Roſabel</hi>) that ſéeing you are the firſt I haue knowne of my kindred, ſo you ſhall alwaies be in all things: for I will neuer obey any with more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>He performed it better then he ſpake it, for neuer couſins loued one an other more, nor <hi>Roſabell</hi> eſtéemed none of his Vncles as hee did ſhe <hi>Tynacrian.</hi> Quickly did Fortune or <hi>Nabatos</hi> power, (through the <hi>Dacians</hi> interceſſion, whom hee accounted as his child) ſeparated them: for the Gréek telling his couſin why he came from <hi>Greece,</hi> and the neceſſitie <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> might be in, forced them as quicke as any thought to ſéeke the Louers.</p>

Till midnight did he gallope ſéeking for <hi>Abſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio,</hi> wiſhing in heart he might arriue in good time to lend him his aide: herein would Fortune ſéeme to fauor him, for euen when faire <hi>Endyminos</hi> loue ſhined faireſt, then heard he a noyſe of blowes and armor claſhing. Lighter then a young wanton Goate, ſpurred hee thitherward, and entring into a ſpacious field, hee ſawe <hi>Syrindas</hi> mightie Louer, like a new <hi>Mars</hi> among his aduerſe Knights. Hée ſtoode a while gazing on him, glad to ſée ſuch haughtie ſtrength, and iudged him woorthie of the Ladies brauerie. He aſſayled them ſaying. To them, to them braue Knight, for their owne weakneſſe ſhall heere confound them.</p>
               <p>The Gréekes couragious words did greatly incourage him, whom knowing, he humbled himſelfe for his good helpe: the which hee not a little néeded, for at that inſtant aboue two hundreth knights vnder the leading of a Captaine Gyant, came marching downe along the fielde againſt the Pagan: this Gyant was king and Lord ouer them all: the furie which they broght, made the Greke feare the looſing of the Lady,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:54"/>
whom he intreated ſéeing her on foote, to get vp to the toppe of the hil, and hid her ſelfe among the trées, whither hee would quickly followe her.</p>
               <p>She did ſo: kindly requeſting the Gréeke to looke vnto the ſafetie of <hi>Abſtruſio.</hi> It gréeued him not to heare her tender ſpéech, purpoſing to marrie them if he could. Then like a thunderbolt hee turned on his enemies: and with <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> ranged vp and downe among them, dyed to the chinne in aduerſe blood, and thogh the Pagan were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wearie with the many battelles of that day, yet the ſight of the Gréekes braue déedes, ſo animated his fainting heart, that hee forgot his wounds, and their paine.</p>
               <p>Such miſerable deſtruction on the hard rypened corne, makes not the ouerflowing of an vnſtayed current paſſing his limits, as the two warriours on thoſe coward knights, giuing no blow in vaine, but ſlew outright, or for euer maimed: which it behooued them ſo to do, beeing onely two, and their enemies ſo many. Followe mee braue knight, (ſaid the Gréeke) for ere we part from hence, I vow to be reuenged on theſe baſe villaines. Do what you will (moſt mightie warriour) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, for Ile obey. His ſhield he caſt at his backe, and tooke his ſword twixt both handes, beginning to execute ſuch déedes as <hi>Mars</hi> would not attempt.</p>
               <p>More feared was not <hi>Hercules</hi> among the <hi>Centaures,</hi> then <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> of his enemies, that beating them downe on euery ſide, at length he metwith the Gyant that ſtole the Ladie, whom he aſſailed with a terrible blowe, and paſt on, where the Pagan ſtayed him till he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when with both handes hee diſcharged his ſword on his thicke helme, whereon the famous Troyans blade finding no reſiſtance, made his head a good way to ſkip from his neck. This pleaſed him not, ſo that aboue tenne loſt their liues in the conflict: for repairing thither, it was as much as to be ledde to the ſlaughter houſe. By this, the Larke the mornings Herauld, mounting into the loftie ayrie ſkies, beganne to ſing the daies approach, welcomming bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> to the Eaſt, when the two warriours like two firie meteors of heauens conſuming wrath, ranging about the battell, encountred in the ende (wearie of killing) with the chiefe and ſole ſuruyor of the Gyants, who roring like a Lyon for his pray, ſéeking them, met, and with them his death: for ſtepping betwéene them, with a heauie Iron mace thought to reuenge himſelfe at two blowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:55"/>It fell out otherwiſe, for the furious Gréeke with one ſtroke cut away halfe his ſhield, and ſorely wounded him. Heere did <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecond him, though it coſt him deare, for thruſting himſelfe vnder the Gyants armes, although hee thruſt a handfull of his ſword in the ſide of his breſt, yet did the Gyant execute his blowe, diſcharging it on the top of his helme, ſo fearcely, that ſenceleſſe it ſtrooke him along vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his horſe. At the noyſe the Gréeke turned about, and thinking his companion dead, no <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> furie may be compared to him. With more eagerneſſe furiouſly flies not the lowring Eagle againſt the ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his neſt, as the Gréeke to be reuenged. Againe would the Gyant raiſe his Mace, when with incomparable ſtrength with one blowe did <hi>Roſabell</hi> throw downe his armes and club: and with a thruſt going to runne through the Gyant, he turned aſide, making the Gréeke ſtrike his head againſt his breſt, with more ſtrength he embraced him, then <hi>Hercules,</hi> when twixt his hands he cruſht to death two ſerpents: yet it auailed him not, wanting one arme: for the Gréeke drawing foorth his dagger, terminated that warre with two cruell ſtabbes. Dead tumbled downe one of the mightieſt Gyans of all thoſe Iſles, whoſe father loſt his life by the hand of the great <hi>Dardario,</hi> &amp; the ſonne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his iuſt reuenge, ſacrificed his blood with honour, being bereft by the Gréek Prince: who fearing to léeſe <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> did execute more then humane deeds.</p>
               <p>Better was not the <hi>Heſperian</hi> fruite kept, before <hi>Alcydes</hi> ſpoyled it, then <hi>Roſabell</hi> defended the ſounded Pagan, offending his enemies on all parts ſo lamentably, that woe was to him that approached to trie the effect of his hands: euen as one awaked from a déepe ſlumper, ſo amazedly the Pagan raiſed himſelfe, and remembring the ſtate wherein hee was, and what the Gréeke had done for him, ſaid to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Iupiter,</hi> let me liue, that I may gratifie this knight, what his déeds on my behalfe haue deſerued. The furious braueneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he behaued himſelfe, ſo animated the ſtout Louer, that as if but then the warre beganne, he beganne to turne himſelfe among them, to the deare coſt of many liues. So <hi>Roſabell</hi> ſpurring his horſe away, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Follow me knight, for our fighting now is to no more purpoſe, the drawing of the mornings brightneſſe comming on ſo faſt, may
<pb facs="tcp:13978:55"/>
make vs looſe the Ladie. The Pagan followed him, for whom the Gréeke hewed out ſuch ample paſſage, as he could reach to effect no blow. They galloped through the thickeſt of the troupes, leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them the cruelleſt ſlaughter that euer was done by two knights. They arriued to the hill where the Lady was, there they diſmounted to ſpeake to her: who full of ioy (guided by Loue) embraced the Pagan, thanking him for his kinde carefull reſcue. She on the inſtant percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her committed error, but could not ſalue it: for <hi>Lyrianas</hi> ſkilfull Louer, ſtraight iudged the cauſe, and being glad thereof, knowing the Pagans will, and conſidering of the ſignes which the Ladie had ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen of her affection towardes him, ſaide to trie what would come of it.</p>
               <p>Now is the time (ſir knight) to end our former battell, that I may right the Ladie which hath called me from ſo farre countries. Both Louers were mooued by the Gréekes wordse, but paſſing that fitte, and waighing what he had done, <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> thus replied. Oh <hi>Ioue</hi> forfende (braue Knight) that ſéeing you haue ſo often ſaued my life this day, I ſhould now imploy it againſt your ſeruice. The glorie and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of the fight is yours: and more then it deſerues your valor, which the heauens haue imparted you: and though it bee more then hell for me to liue without this ſoueraigne Ladie, ſo I may ſéeme gratefull to your deſeruings, my ſelfe ſhall force my ſelfe to forgoe this happineſſe, which is the onely nouriſher of my forlorne life.</p>
               <p>Woorthie the honour of your high merits (excellent knight) hath this your anſwere béene (ſaid <hi>Roſabell</hi>) and I doe in heart wiſh my faint woorthes were now equal to my will, that I might (were it but in part) pay the great bonds your liberall bountie hath bound me in: and ſince this Ladie is now infranchiſed and frée, I am readie (as I promiſed her Damzell) to conduct her to her kingdome, or where elſe ſhe pleaſe. Whereto ſhe ſpake. Euer ſince (ſir knight) my fortunes made mee néed your helpe, I put my honour in your hands, and ſo I am ſure you wil (conſidering my neceſſitie) protect it, in liew whereof, I vow obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all your commaunds.</p>
               <p>It fittes ſo ill (faire <hi>Syrinda</hi>) with my conditions, (ſpake the Gréeke) to guard Ladies, as the experience I haue of my owne miſfortunes, enforceth mee refuſe this charge, leauing it in the hands of this mightie knight, proteſting, that if I had a ſiſter, and
<pb facs="tcp:13978:56"/>
with her many kingdomes, I would commit her to none other. And ſéeing you haue ſo plainly heard my will, I expect your reply according to yours, that hereafter I may ſerue Ladies after a new manner. I knowe not whether of the two were more ioyed with the Princes words, but the Ladie with the accuſtomed baſhfulneſſe in ſuch caſes, thus replied.</p>
               <p>It well appeares (ſir knight) you would by all good waies procure my good will to accompliſh yours. But that you may ſée, there is in me no leſſe acknowledgement of your deſerts, then in this knight, for what on my behalfe you haue performed, I once againe ſubmit my ſelfe to your order, to diſpoſe of him at your content, aſſured that a knight of your worth, wil regard my pure honour as your owne: for hauing put my ſelfe in your hands, the lawes of knighthood binds mée to it. The Gréeke did highly (as reaſon would) eſtéeme what the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die did, and vnwilling to deferre the happie content which the Pagan might receiue, did preſently eſpouſe them on the top of that hill, with more ioy then if they were in their rich royall pallace. Witneſſes they did not want, for at the contract there were preſent, the beauteous Nimphes <hi>Oreades</hi> and <hi>Hamadryades,</hi> with many hairie <hi>Siluan</hi> Gods.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke by telling them who hee was, did very much pleaſe the new betrothed couple. There they paſt away the remnant of the night in pleaſant chat, for the Pagan with gladneſſe felt not his wounds, and the Gréeke not willing to diſturbe their content, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his own. But when <hi>Apollos</hi> light expelled <hi>Cynthias</hi> darkneſſe from the heauen, all thrée tooke their next way to the Cittie, where hearing what had befallen, they had armed aboue twentie thouſand men, the which ſeuerall waies diuided in many troupes went to ſéeke their king. Many of them they met, that greatly reioyced ſéeing him well, who gaue order for the recalling of the reſt backe againe, which was ſo well followed, that before noone they all returned. In honour of the Nuptials, throughout the Cittie and all the Kingdome, many triumphs and Iouſts were ordained: therein the Gréeke ſhewed the incomparable valor of his perſon. Hee continued there in the cure of his wounds aboue a month, ſo tendred and honored, as in <hi>Greece</hi> he could be no more. So thankfull did the Ladie ſhew her ſelfe by her tender care and carefull attendance, that the Greeke accounted all his
<pb facs="tcp:13978:56"/>
paines well beſtowed for her. At length thinking it time, he tolde the Prince how neceſſarie his departure was.</p>
               <p>It extreamely gréeued them, for they loued him as a brother: They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to ſtay one eight dayes more, till the ending of an armour which the Lady had cauſed to be made, hee was conſtrained to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not go without them.</p>
               <p>I well appeared by their riches, the good will they beare to him: they likewiſe gaue him a luſtie ſtrong Courſer, wherewith, and with the armes the Prince was well pleaſed. He tooke his leaue of braue <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſio,</hi> and not without many teares from <hi>Syrindas</hi> faire eyes. They remained ſo affected vnto him, that when the Gréeke warres were knowne, this was one brought great ayde thither, dooing the Gréekes ſuch good ſeruice, that thereby they ſufficiently paide the Prince, who with ſome gréefe for their abſence in a well rigged ſhip, Nauigated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nyquea,</hi> thinking he ſhuld ſooner there then in any other place, heare of his Lady.</p>
               <p>On the fift Nauigation, Fortune already beeing weary of her ſtay, would ſhew him one of her fierceſt changes, for obtaining <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> fauour, ſhe conſpired with <hi>Eolus</hi> topſey turuey to ouerturne the ſeas, raiſing ſuch tempeſtuous ſtormes, that the Prince ſaw himſelfe a thouſand times in the hands of death: ſometimes mounted aloft vpon the deuouring rigges of a waue, as high as a heauens wéeping face, and then tumbling downe, as lowe as the loweſt Center of the déepe, thinking himſelfe and ſhippe ouerwhelmed in thoſe mercileſſe waters, accompanying the watery dwellers in their Cauerns. Then would he pittie his weake ouermatched veſſell, to ſée it ſtriue againſt two ſuch mightie Elementall foes, for hauing loſt by furie of the raging windes, all her ſayles, her maſſes, and tackels aboue, was belowe ſo cruelly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with the ſeas, remorſeleſſe ſurges, that beating at her belly and ſides, had hewed their paſſage through her ribbes, entring her breaches ſo without all pitie, that neither by pumping, nor any other means, her leakes were vnable to be ſtenched, that the poore Marriners tyred with labour, amazed at the tempeſts, fierceneſſe and confounded with death: ſubmitted to the pittileſſe mercie of windes and waters, whoſe pittious woful clamors piercing the roaring noyſe of their oppoſed enemies, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the high heauens. The caſting ouerboord, of goods, anchors and tables, nothing doth auaile, and what in haſte they cannot hurle ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:57"/>
the furious winde doth blowe away, and that it leaues, an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſurge doth waſh into the ſea.</p>
               <p>Thus hopeleſſe of all remedie toſſed vp and downe, for the vnbrideled rage of violent fighting windes, being vnchained from the earthes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure concauities, blew fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery corner nothing but conſuming wrath, death and diſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tying their force vpon the ſmal weak veſſell, which they had torne in many places. Foure dayes fought they thus againſt the vnceaſing diſmal tempeſts, in the end whereof, the poore death-fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſaylers ſéeming to foreſée an vnlooked for calme, a ſudden furious Southerne blaſt opened the torne Barke, leauing the diſtreſſed louer grapling at a planke vpon the whiſtling Billowes, and yet with his ſword in his mouth: for without it (pittifull Ladies) he would not die. With ſuch violence blew the windes, that violently on a flintie Rocke they hurled him, to whoſe top, with the ſtrength of his armes he got. From whence he looked to ſée what would become of the ſhip and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, where he ſaw the lamentable ſpectacle, the poore Maiſter ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the waters, vpon a Cheſt, whereon he ſet all his hope, till a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring waue came and bereft him of both it and life. The grones hee heard, of the reſt that periſhed, ſéeing the fardels, packes, truſſes, caper on the dauncing billowes, and foming waues. No courage preuailed with them, nor their continuall liuing on the ſeas: for euery one (as it is wont) it buried in her watery bowels. So extreame ſorrowfull remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prince of great <hi>Britaine</hi> at the lamentable ſpectacle, that with teares in his eyes he burſt forth into this paſſion. Oh ſupreame high heauens, how no man in this miſerable world may iuſtly call himſelfe, ſure or happie? There is no ſtate, no dignitie, nor office how high ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be aduanced, but is by Fortune, ſubiect to the greateſt and moſt dangerous falles? Him call I happie that leaſt doth ſet his confidence in Fortune, or hath leaſt receiued of her blinde gifts, terming her beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, the threatning of greater miſerie. What good is there on earth but is mingled with a thouſand vnſauorie diſpleaſing euilles, and of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, miſfortunes, and lamentable euentes, ſuch and ſo many, that onely leaue him with his bare name, ouerpreſſing the ſoule with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gréeuing the perplexed minde with moſt gréeuous and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paines?</p>
               <p>After that, by little and little the furie of the ſea was aſſwaged, he haſted to a coppes that not farre from thence he eſpied, there to drie
<pb facs="tcp:13978:57"/>
his clothes, and himſelfe. There <hi>Trebatios</hi> haughtie Nephew diſro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed himſelfe, leauing but his onely ſhert vpon him, remembring with ſome tenderneſſe the troubles he had ouerpaſt: iudging by the greatnes of them, they would at length, wearie of themſelues, bring him to a delectable ſweete ende, that then with the preſent happineſſe he might ioyfully recount his former infelicities.</p>
               <p>This conſideration ſomewhat animated him, ſuffering that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe more patiently. Example ſhould they take by him, that in leſſe dangers forget to make vſe of ſufferance, eſtéeming that death, which peraduenture the celeſtiall powers doth but ordaine for tryall of theyr workes.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke againe apparelled himſelfe, his veſtments beeing drie, and laid him downe to reſt, neuer more deſtitute thereof then at that inſtant: it was little, for ſtraight hee wakened to ſéeke ſome path which might leade him to ſome Village: hee found it, but with ſome trouble: for without it, nothing deſired is lightly obtained. And going along the ſame, there happened to him, what the inſuing Chapter doth mention.</p>

               <p>With this hope trauelled hee on foote, onely with his ſword, hauing taken the ſtraighteſt and moſt troden path.

<pb facs="tcp:13978:58"/>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> at the Tryumphes. She was very young, hauing not yet attained to <hi>14.</hi> yeares, which made her as children vſe, walke to ſport her ſelfe about thoſe woods that bordered on her garden: and hauing loſt her ſelfe with one Lady, from the reſt of her attendants, ſo amazed was not <hi>Venus,</hi> when ſhe firſt ſaw the boy <hi>Adonis</hi> along the banks of <hi>Nylus,</hi> as with admiration the bewtious <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the Gréeke Princes ſight that lay vpon the graſſe, ſéeming more faire then when young <hi>Apollo</hi> in habit of a ſhéepheard tended <hi>Aleſtes</hi> Goates. He was big of body, his other parts and liniaments are already ſet downe, although now he entered into <hi>20,</hi> they were better perfected. With more deſire did the Lady gaze on him, then in the woods of <hi>Troy,</hi> the thrée faire Goddeſſes expected <hi>Paris</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>So much ſhe yéelded to the ſight, that ſhee began to féele a newe alteration neuer felt before in her heart: for being but a childe, ſhe yet knew not the meaning of Loues pretie fooleries. With ſome woonder ſhe turned to her damzell, with theſe words. Haſt thou euer ſéene more perfect bewtie then this gallant youth doth ſhew? I beléeue that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at his byrth, angrie with her ſelfe, did thus create him to deſpight her ſelfe: I cannot thinke but he is child to ſome of our immortal Gods, that haue now ſent him on the earth to alienate all ſtraungers wits.</p>
               <p>Which if it be ſo, we Ladies muſt ſtrengthen our ſelues with courage, for I feare, the wiſeſt will néed it to ſcape frée of his ſight, ſo abſolute is he in all things. This aduice came too late to the tender Lady, for Loue had already made her his Goddeſſe till the death: neither had ſhe power to vntie the knot wherewith blinde <hi>Cupid</hi> had bound her hart, tying it ſo hard, as he left it inſoluble.</p>
               <p>I pittie thée gallant <hi>Eufroniſa,</hi> that in the nonage of thy yeares, thou ſhuldeſt begin ſo ſower an office, as to be ſubiect to an vnknown lord, I wold willingly giue thée ſome conſolation, but ſo much I do want it, as rather for both I ſhould procure it. No vaine, no colour, no faſhion was in the Brytanickes face, but ſhe coted it within her very ſoule, giuing it the ſhadow, and her heart the ſubſtance, which being ſo tender and vnacquainted with change, tooke ſuch impreſſion, that neuer Lady yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more to loue then <hi>Eufroniſa.</hi> Now ſhe deſires to ſpeake to him, then feares ſhe. Already becomes ſhe ſuſpicious, that neuer learned to loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:59"/>Before ſhe knew who he was, ſhe became ſo ſkilfull in the Art, that ſhe feared whether he loued, whether he could loue or acknowledge anies ſoueraigntie. Now ſhe that ſtaines the bluſhing of the mornings Sunne, becomes enuious of her owne thoughts, and doth diſtruſt her owne worths, ſéeking new deuiſes and inuented meanes to be beloued, deſeruing for her owne bewtie, <hi>Ioues</hi> immortal worſhip. Oh <hi>Cupids</hi> blind ſnares, happineſſe in miſery, a plague in pleaſure, and grief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, found vnſought for, and yet a torment that contains a moſt ſwéete life. By her amazedneſſe, perceiued the damzel her Ladies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie, wherefore ſhe merily ſaid: Let vs awake this knight, and try whether his bewtie haue more force waking or ſléeping. Doo what you wil (replied ſhe) although it be no modeſtie conſidering who we be. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waighing that, I thinke it beſt to do it (ſaid the wittie <hi>Selia</hi>) to ſée what he is that hath ſuch power ouer Ladies: for if his merits equals all other parts requiſite in a good knight, he may call himſelfe one of the happieſt in the world. So long continued the Ladies in their amourous chat, that the Prince awaked with theſe words. Oh fortune, how doeſt thou flatter my hopes, for if thou giueſt me any good, tis only dreaming, that when I wake to ſee it, I finde it but an illuſion. He ſaid no more, for the Ladies ſight ſtaied him, both from the publiſhing his woes, as of the cauſe of them. He roſe, admiring the Ladies bewtie: who firſt ſpake thus. You ſhould ſéeme to haue fewe enemies (ſir knight) ſéeing ſo careleſly you lye and ſléepe in paſſages ſo open, that any by you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, may at his pleaſure right himſelfe. He anſwered: So croſſe and auſtere hath my fortune alwaies bene moſt bewteous Ladie, that it did neuer let me knowe the ſtate wherin I might ſay I had a friend, for euen my owne thoughts doo moſt within my breſt, make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my reſt: wherefore hauing none to truſt vnto, forceth me to ſet my ſelfe in the hands of euery one, that one in this generalitie, would ſhewe the office of a friend, by taking away my deſpiſed life, then as ſuch a one I ſhould account him, for by the déed giuing me one death, he riddes me of a thouſand that I ſuffer in continuall languiſhment: and it, might I wel call life: for he liues well, that féeles no more pain. Great is your griefe (anſwered the Ladie) and of force to drawe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration from the hardeſt heart, and greater it is, ſéeing that none pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you, were it but with a counterfeit remedie, noting the waight of your complaints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:59"/>In faith (faire Ladie) ſaid the Prince, ſo mightie are my oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that although I know them, and the paine I endure by them, yet I muſt ſuffer them, for if I liue, it is by liuing in paine, ſo that ſhould I, but neuer ſo litle eaſe this paine, it would be ſéene in the want of my health.</p>
               <p>If it doth ſo pleaſe you (replied the Ladie) vniuſtly you complaine, and I thinke you greatly wrong your Ladie, terming her cruel. My complaints (moſt ſoueraigne Ladie) are not ſo much ment againſt my lifes directneſſe, as againſt my vnhappie ſtarres, that make me infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in fauours, but not in my imployment, for neuer was any better, but in ſuch a place where my griefs be ſcorned. Some reaſon you haue (ſaid the Lady) hauing this occaſion to bewaile: for where ſorrow is not regarded, there is a double griefe, and gladly would I know who you are, and where borne, for you ſéeme a ſtraunger in theſe parts. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obey your ſoueraigne commaund (moſt excellent Lady) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Gréeke: I was borne in the fartheſt Confines of great <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi> and am called <hi>Corolano,</hi> caſt by fowle weather and tempeſt of the ſea, on this Countrey, paſſing ſo many troubles, that had I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch vnexpected comfort with your faire ſight, no doubt, but that my ſoule ſéeing the bodie drenched in miſery, and as vnworthie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, had it forſaken me, but to enioy within it the view of your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſight, gaue life to her liueleſſe habitation: And that I may commit no error (for it is impoſſible but I haue incurred ſome) ſuffer my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by your admittance to make me deſeruer to know the name of the land ſo happie in the poſſeſſion of ſuch admirable brauery. Quickly doo you require a payment for the diſcouery of your name (Sir knight) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Selia,</hi> (for the Princeſſe could not, buſied in her new and painfull buſineſſe) but becauſe you ſhall not altogither iudge your ſelfe vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in your pretences, know this land is called <hi>Sylepſia,</hi> whereof this Lady is Princeſſe, and going on hunting, we loſt our company and our ſelues: yet wee haue not hunted ill, hauing founde the amourouſeſt knight in the world: and ſo according to your ſhowes, none like you haue better aſſuraunce of the Louers Tent, whoſe aduenture was newly brought into this Cittie, and the proofe thereof ſhall within theſe foure daies be begunne, and little ſhall you not pleaſe vs to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your perſon in the tryall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:60"/>I am ſo ill prouided of Armor and other neceſſaries, (faire damzell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the tender Prince) that though I were vnwilling to do it, yet to content your bewties, with them I would try it, aſſured that for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and being vnfortunate, to me the glory is onely due.</p>
               <p>This want ſhall not hinder you (ſaid <hi>Eufroniſa</hi>) for I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with the beſt armor that euer you ſaw, earſt belonging to the firſt king that raigned in this countrey, named <hi>Terſio,</hi> equall in ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of Fortitude and Wiſedome, ſtrengthened by Art and ſkill wherewith he forged them, and neuer were ſéene by any. Theſe ile ſend you by this damzell, firſt ſwearing you ſhall not abſent your ſelfe from this Kingdome without my leaue, and in our Pallace ſhall you be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>
               <p>The amorous Lady ſpake ſo plainly, as the Prince could perceiue Loues new wound. There is none ſo deſtitute of iudgement, but wold haue weighed what he obtained to be beloued of ſo faire a dame: for if the Prince had euer ſéene pure bewtie, ſhe was the perfect ſtampe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: in whoſe creation, Nature the olde <hi>Mars</hi> of liuing forme, had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vtmoſt of her ſkill, modeling her liniaments, more abſolute then thought could wiſh. Among ſo fewe yeares as they both had, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene completer excellencies: ſo he anſwered. Who dares moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lady, ſhew himſelfe ſo vngratefull to the fauours imparted by your rare bewty, as to commit a fault ſo hainous to depart from you without your licenſe? I am ſo long ſince captiue to anothers wil, as now to acknowledge it anew is no pain, but rather chéefeſt happines, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whom I owe ſeruice. Why then (ſaid ſhe) we may be gon, aſſured you will do no otherwiſe, and this night will I ſend you horſe and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, whoſe ſight will content you: In the meane time hyde your ſelfe amongſt theſe Pynes: for hauing loſt our ſelues, it cannot bee but our Guard will ſeeke vs out.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke now had no more will but to fulfill the Ladies: and ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue of the young childe, already olde in loue, he thruſt himſelf into the the thickeſt thereof. Without a thouſand embracements ſhe had not ſent him, feared ſhe not to be too much noted of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tonneſſe, yet with her eyes ſhe expreſt her hearts deſire. They are (ſoueraign dames) the tongueleſſe meſſengers that beſt make knowne the paine and plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of the ſoules. Better ſignes of like or diſlike, is there not, then the motion of thoſe ſpéechleſſe ſpeakers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:60"/>As one rapt in a duſtie blacke clowde, ſo ſéemed <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> in abſence of her ſonne. Ay me (my <hi>Selia</hi>) ſaid the amorous Ladie, what in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious lucke croſſes my tenderneſſe to affect the knight that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie another granted the poſſeſſion, of his ſoule? Who can loue him, knowing hee affects another, wherewith the heauens haue adorned mee, and yet not made me proude? for if he loues another, how ſhall I loue him, being ſure that for my ſight hee will not violate the promiſe of his ſacrificed faith, and yet who will not dote on him? What incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences can reſtraine me from his loue? what infamie, what diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or what ſtaine of maidens fame may befall me, but my ſoule will regardleſſe trample on, ſo with equall loue her paines might be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Why, I doo not feare the fooliſh rude reports of common multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, when they ſhall ioyne their mouthes to fames ſhrill trumpe, far and neare to ſound my ſhame, when this my folly ſhall bee noyſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad I will loue and dote on him, and yet I do beléeue, that doing ſo, I do not ſufficiently anſwere the merits of his valour, nor noble carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his minde.</p>
               <p>And though it be a torment intollerable, to knowe another is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrined in his breſt, I cannot refuſe the diuine appoyntment, nor what heerein my hapleſſe fates ordaine: for otherwiſe, none more happie then I in loue: and I cannot beléeue he is as hee hath ſaid to bee, for theſe that haue the power to bee beloued of euerie one, doo neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe their true names, countrie, and eſtates, wherefore wee muſt by all meanes procure to learne his certaine name, for beeing intreated thereto, I do not doubt but he will.</p>
               <p>That he is eaſie to be knowne (anſwered the damozell) hauing him in our lodging, for if he be in loue, (as he ſéemed to be) being alone, hee will publiſh it, and perchance more then we now wiſh, for intire loue cannot be huſht in ſecret, and euery one too much bragges of this blind opinion, as to account the greateſt comfort to participate the inward thoughts, to ſtones, to wals, to groues, to fields, and windes. Ay me (my <hi>Selia</hi>) by experience thou doeſt ſhew to haue ben in loue (ſaid <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froniſa</hi>) who can diſcourſe of ſeas, of rockes, of ſhallowes, and of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, but ſuch as haue nauigated, ſcapt and paſt them? What is hée that feares his enemie, that hath not béene wounded at his hands? If this bee ſo, and thou ſo ſkilfull, I will repoſe the truſt of this my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, on thy diſcretion and experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:61"/>Had it béene for nothing but to helpe you in this tempeſt, (ſoueraigne Ladie) anſwered <hi>Selia,</hi> I account the time well beſtowed, I ſpent in Loues toyes, letting my ſoule confeſſe with content, anothers ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. I am well acquainted with Loues deuiſes and his allurements: I know where he is reſiſted, there enuiouſly hee ſtriues to ſubiugate new forces, cauſing afterwards greater paines for refuſing his deitie, and denying his prerogatiue ouer all the world, as hee that can onely giue life or death with ioy. Why then (my deare <hi>Selia</hi>) ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, it is likely he wil not ſo cruelly tyrannize ouer me, that willingly admitted the heauie yoake of his ſlauerie, as he vſeth againſt them that leuied armes and warre againſt his power. <hi>Selia</hi> anſwered. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund no condition of this God, is beſt for gouerning abſolutely by himſelfe, doth not (being blinde) conſider the gréeuous paines the ſoule indures, and many times with a little, reſts hee more content, (in the end hee is but a childe) then if a thouſand hearts were ſacrificed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his wrath. They could procéed no further in their ſweet chat, for many knights came to them that carefully did ſéeke them, fearing ſome diſgrace had befallen them. They were glad whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they met them, ſo altogither returned to the Cittie, for the Princeſſe would no longer ſtay, hauing alreadie foode to nouriſh her conceits.

He did it, deſiring to do her ſeruice, which when ſhe knew, making him ſweare to keepe her counſell, ſhe bad him go with <hi>Selia,</hi> for ſhe had promiſed a knight to furniſh him, to prooue the Louers tent. So leauing her, they arriued in good time at the fountaine, where they found the Gréeke ouerwhelmed in imaginations, expecting the Ladies commaund. After courteſies paſt on either ſide, <hi>Selia</hi> ſaid.

They were not vttered with ſuch ſilence, but might bee heard by <hi>Aſtorildo</hi> Prince of <hi>Callidonia,</hi> brother to the beauteous <hi>Roſamond,</hi> that departing from his ſiſter in <hi>Greece,</hi> (glad in his ſoule to ſée her ſo well beſtowed) tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled to ſéeke aduentures through the world, performing many braue déeds vnder the name of the knight of the <hi>Griffon,</hi> all which are at large ſet downe in the <hi>Chronicles Lupercio</hi> writ of all the Pagans acts. <hi>Galtenor</hi> doth not here mention them, becauſe they appertained not vnto the ſtorie he compoſed. So now was the frée Pagan ouerhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Gréekes complaints: he was not mooued at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for he had not yet yéelded his libertie to loue. A while he ſtayed, thinking the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint would further procéed. It fell out as hee would haue it, for hee vttered many pittifull exclaimes, afore <hi>Auroras</hi> ſhining in the heauens, yet could he not by them iudge who he was, more then the conſtancie he publiſht of his Loue: who was ſo carefull to go vnto the Cittie, that in the inſtant he put on the rich armour <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> had ſent him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:62"/>Such were they as appertained to a nouell knight, all white, bur gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with many flowers of precious Rubies. They greatly pleaſed him, being of the beſt in the world, as alſo becauſe with ſuch of like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, he departed from <hi>Nyquea,</hi> and combatted with his father. His ſhield was like his armour, in middle thereof, bearing the picture of <hi>Faith,</hi> held by a white hand, which for all that two Serpents with their ſtinges did pricke, would not looſen it. The word this.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Loues greefes the longer,</l>
                  <l>Holds <hi>Faith</hi> the ſtronger.</l>
                  <l>Though orepreſſed: ſtill my ſelfe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Clad in theſe faire armes, and mounted on a luſtie Courſer, did <hi>Trebatios</hi> haughtie Nephew pace on towards the famous cittie, glad to ſée it with ſo many <hi>Danubious</hi> ſtreames, which made it one of the fertileſts ſoyles in the world.</p>
               <p>The ſame way did he ſpye the valiant <hi>Aſtorildo,</hi> in faire gréene armour full of Pomegranates, and on his ſhielde a fearfull Griffon. Wonders had <hi>Roſabell</hi> heard of him, reioycing to ſée him of ſuch braue diſpoſition: ſo did he admire the Gréeke, ſuppoſing he was him, that in the Forreſt he had heard complaine, hee gazed on him a while, iudging his behauiour to excel his that in <hi>Grecia</hi> had ouerthrown him. Hauing each met with the other, they extended ſuch courteſie, as they iudged eithers merits to deſerue. The <hi>Callidonian</hi> ſpake firſt in that countrie language, ſaying.</p>
               <p>I would gladly knowe (ſir knight) who you are, for it ſéemeth to mee, I haue ſéene you farre from hence. In the ſame tongue replyed the Gréeke, beeing well ſkild in moſt. I am (ſir knight) of ſuch remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted countrie, that though I ſhould tell my name, you could not knowe me: notwithſtanding through thoſe places I haue trauelled, and where I am beſt knowne, I am called the Knight of the <hi>Flowers,</hi> beeing by ſtormes and fortune of the ſeas, caſt on this land, where I vnderſtood, there is in the Kings Court, a certaine aduenture arriued very lately, which ere I did depart, I was willing to know and prooue it, hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but little thereby, being on Ladies behalfes, whoſe ſeruice brings with it a reward for any paine how great ſoeuer, although it ſhould be thought none done in a Ladies name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:62"/>There is reaſon (replied the <hi>Callidonian</hi>) to procure their content with perill of our liues, but this muſt be with aſſurance of reward. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gréeke anſwered. Then deſerues he not to bee beloued, that doth it for reward. Neuer (ſir knight) was that loue famous, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a recompence was propoſed, which muſt by deſerued loue be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for as loue is the motion of a noble act, for which all good is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the thing loued, ſo doth not hee merit that honoured, title that ſéekes it for any other thing, vnleſſe it bee to let the world admire the rareneſſe of his quallities, not inclining to the other, which rather is a price prefixt for loue, diſhonouring the reputation of the Louer, and diſableth his worthes, through the hopes of that guerdon which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might make him moſt happie. And well it ſéemes you knowe not what it is to bee anothers, alleadging ſuch an irronious opinion, condemned of all that knowe what happineſſe it is, happily to loue, which makes me ſmyle to thinke how ſafe the Tent is from you, for being to be giuen to louers, your libertie excludes you from that priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which by being one, you haue obtained. I would not haue you ſo raſhly iudge, by what you knowe not (replied the Pagan) for you may be deceiued. How ſhould I be (ſaid the Gréeke) hearing you ſo plainly vrge your libertie? Nay then (returned the <hi>Callidonian</hi>) that you may know the vnaduiſedneſſe of your iudgement, I ſay, none ſhall prooue it, vnleſſe he firſt prooue mee vpon the ſpéeches wee haue vrged, for who the diuell hath euer loued, without hope of ſomething. That hope (anſwered <hi>Roſabell</hi> ſomewhat mooued) the Louer muſt not haue, but leaue it in the Ladies diſpoſe, for it is ſhee muſt conſider the merits of that faith, wherewith ſhee ſées ſhee is adored, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe deſerts and her bountie, ſhe yéeldes the due reward. And I am ſorrie wee ſhould with new brawles enter into the Pallace, and I beeing firſt aduertiſed of the aduenture, the firſt triall ought to bee mine. And ſo about both matters (hauing now opportunitie) let our battell be, with this condition, (leaſt we want time for the aduentures promiſed) that hee which forgoeth firſt his ſaddle, ſhall not ſée the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, vnleſſe he be commaunded by the conqueror. Nothing doth better pleaſe me (ſaid <hi>Aſtorildo</hi>) that you may know your error by your loue.</p>
               <p>So theſe two famous warriours turned their horſes brauely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting each other. More horror makes not the furious waues, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:13978:63"/>
on the ſtonie rockes, then they by their incounters.</p>
               <p>The Pagan was one of the greateſt that the Gréeke had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for it caſt him backwards on his horſe, with loſſe of both ſtirrops: but the Pagan chaunced woorſe, for <hi>Mars</hi> on horſebacke equalled not the Prince, that met him ſo ſtrongly, that fetching him cleane from his ſaddle, he fel on his féete. Recouer he would his ſeate before the Gréek returned, hauing the bridle in his hand, but the horſe ſtarting at his offer, mounted aloft and put him from it, that the Gréeke when hée turned, ſawe him on the ground: where hee required the combat with the ſword. We ſhould ſo ſtay ouerlong (ſaid the Greeke) for fear ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made me condition thus: but we ſhall haue time ere you depart this land to do it, the which I promiſe to performe, bee it but to diſſwade you from your hereſie. And that you may beginne to credit me, I am content you firſt prooue the aduenture, ſo ſhall you ſée what aduantage you ſhould haue, not hauing this opinion which your libertie makes you maintaine. Otherwiſe could not the Pagan do, for noted he would not be of diſcourteſie: ſo he promiſed to accompliſh it, and mounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine like two great friendes, they tooke their way to the Cittie, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing there at the firſt houre after noone, when all the principall thereof repaired to the Pallace to ſée the aduentures proofe, togither with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny valiant ſtraungers that about it were thither come. As theſe two warriours paſſed through the ſtréetes, al the peoples eies they drew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, admiring to ſée them ſo well armed, &amp; of ſo braue diſpoſition. Gallanter Knights were not in that Cittie ſéene of many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As too and fro the ſtreetes were croſſed by paſſengers that went to the Court, and they doing the like, the ſunnes ſplendent rayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerberated on their glittering armour, as no ſence could more deſire. The amorous <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> loſt not this ſight, for ſtanding on a turret, ſhe ſawe the maieſticke pacing of her gallant, and ſaid vnto her ſelfe, ſhée had giuen him but litle to make him Lord only of her hart. There is no. Ladie (ſaide Loues newe Scholler) that hath more reaſon to loue then I, ſince (in my opinion) the Gods haue not reſerued vnto themſelues, more grace, more brauerie, nor more woorth, then they haue beſtowed on this knight. Somwhat did this deefied couple prick their horſes, and paſſing vnder the Ladies being, the Gréek made his, bend his knées to the ground, and his head lower then his breſt. The Ladie ſéeing it, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelfe to do him courteſie, which as a fauor ſhe beſtowed, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting how ſhe might be noted for it. Near her ſtood her wittie <hi>Selia,</hi> that burſt into theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:63"/>I cannot blame you, (ſoueraigne Princeſſe) for louing him that was borne to be beloued, and if for him you ſuffer, he hath with him a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for your greateſt maladie, and therefore doo not complaine, for if you do, Ile ſweare you do diſſemble. She anſwered. If there wore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with him, that would ſo well plead my deſerts to him, as hee hath here to read his merits to my beléefe, it might bee I ſhould bee able to diſſemble my paine when it takes me: &amp; yet can I not denie what thou alledgeſt, for his gallant behauior is a comfort in middeſt of my greateſt woes. The two famous Knights alighted, for the hall (being one of the faireſt in the world) was full of knights, that expected the proofe of the Louers Pauillion. In the outward yarde they left their horſes, and as friends togither entred into the hall, hauing round about an infinite of rich ſeates, excepting a corner, purpoſely hung and reſerued for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that then entred, whoſe beautie and brauerie delighted euerie heart. The moſt beauteous <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> would not differ in her colour of garments from the <hi>Brittains</hi> armor, apparrelling her ſelfe al in white, imbrodered with red roſes, that neuer to the Ladies ſight it admitted no compare. The Gréeke did note it well, &amp; ſmiled at it. This occaſion expected <hi>Cupid</hi> to yoake the breſt of warlike <hi>Aſtorildo,</hi> that in ſcorne of him had long time led his life: and ſo with the ſight of the Ladies rare beautie, he was beſet with new deſires, féeling his heart ſubdued. A wound was this he receiued, that onely death cured, for that ſolely had power to remedie it: for the Ladie buſied her eies gazing on the Gréek, he thinking on <hi>Lyriana,</hi> in whom his hopes, life, &amp; felicitie conſiſteth. So that only Loue muſt pleaſe this third intruder: for <hi>Aſtorildo</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die loues, his life depends on his alienation: now he gréeues for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting combat with the Greeke, ſéeing it toucheth what hee adores, and with a word he hath euen now changed his opinion, by beeing in loue, and without hope euer to obtain any recompence for his diſtreſſe. And yet the Ladie ſcorning the firmneſſe wherewith he loues her, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it in affecting him that laughes at her, becauſe he dotes vpon <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi> So the Ladies ſate them down, being aboue a hundreth in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, daughters to the chiefe Nobles of the Realme. When all were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, an ancient graue man, for ſo he was that brought the Tent, did ſet it in middle of the hall. A fairer péece was neuer ſéene: it was all of blew Sattin, imbroderad with Artechokes of golde, ſet with ſo many ſtones, that their ſplendor depriued the ſight of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:64"/>At the doore thereof appeared two knights richly armed, that ſéemed to challenge the fight of euery one preſent: within was ſéene a faire throne, wheron ſate a Lady of excéeding beautie, holding in her hands a crowne of ineſtimable value. Thus euery one expecting to knowe of the ancient knight the ſum of the aduenture, the Ladies and knights yéelding him gratefull audience, he beganne to recite the cauſe of his comming, whoſe relation deſerues a new Chapter, inferring mee to intreat of you, faire wonders of natures beauties like attention, for now haue I moſt néede thereof, expreſſing a matter of it ſelfe ſo worthie to be knowne.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. How the knight ending his relation of his aduenture, his knights began to prooue it, and what them befell.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt high and mightie King of <hi>Sylepſia</hi> (began the ancient knight) in the Southerne parts and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, there ſometimes dwelled a man in the hidden and ſecret miſteries of Art and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromanticke ſpels the ſkilfulleſt of his time, whoſe knowledge and great wiſedome could not keepe him from the ſnares of deceitfull loue, who intrapt him with the beautie of <hi>Beliſa,</hi> daughter to the king of <hi>Arabia</hi> the <hi>Felix,</hi> one of the faireſt Ladies on the earth, who gouerned with higher thoughts, admitted not the wiſe <hi>Nycoſtratos</hi> affection. He atchiued many woorthie déeds in her ſeruice, yet all would not preuaile to mooue the Ladies loue, nor yet to ſhew him one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited fauor, which put him in ſuch deſperation, as daily he neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the eſtimation of his credit, &amp; more &amp; more loſt his health. On this Ladie were alſo inamored two Princes, alike in valour and deſerts, though one was more happie hauing the Ladies fauor: who fedde him with thoſe hopes that they are woont to giue their louers, al which was woorſe then death to the wiſe man, as alſo to the other knight reiected.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Nycoſtrato</hi> knowing it, as alſo the approach of his liues fatall houre, &amp; finding that <hi>Beliſa</hi> was cauſe thereof, purpoſed ere he leſt the world, to be reuenged, &amp; ſo formed he this wondrous Tent, where hée inchanted the Ladie, bereauing her of iudgement, for the litle reſpect ſhe had made of his great loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:64"/>Alſo he enchaunted the two louers to defend the entrance, vntill there were a knight ſo amorous and valiant, but as vnhappie as eyther, that by vanquiſhing might reſtore them their loſt libertie. And <hi>Beliſa,</hi> by the Lady that without exception, beſt deſerued the tytle of conſtant Louer, yet woorſe rewarded: for onely this &amp; to be fayreſt, muſt frée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted <hi>Beliſa.</hi> In the eſtate they be, they ſuffer many torments: for ſo pleaſed it <hi>Nycoſtrato,</hi> the more to ſatiſfie his reuenge. That knight that is fauoured by Fortune, ſhall end the Combat, muſt after leade the Lady that will prooue the aduenture. In many courts of mightie kings haue we bene, hoping to finde ſome knight to ſet a periode to our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: but the Princes being valiant, and the Lady very faire, none hath preuailed, no not ſo much as in the entrance. Almoſt diſpairing euer to finde remedie for theſe Princes, I heard of the famous knight and bewtious Ladyes of your Court. With ſome better hope I turned hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which I truſt will not be fruſtrated, conſidering the worthies here aſſembled of eyther kinde. So I humblie beſeech your Maieſtie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund your knights vnto the proofe, for no ſmall honour ſhall hee win that ends it.</p>
               <p>There were ſo many deſirous of it, as they expected but the kings commaund, among them were two of the kings Coozens, both louers and reputed valiant. Many proouing the entrance, and looſing it, made ſhew of their valour, attributing their loſſe not to it, but to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in loue, and ſo returned with great comfort, thinking they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained much thereby. The Prince of <hi>Laronia,</hi> a young knight, but a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table louer, prepared himſelfe: who drawing forth his ſword, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the two competitors, beginning a well ſought combat: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while he retyred backe, vnable to endure his enemies ſtrong blowes.</p>
               <p>No longer ſtayed the kings two Coozens, but one after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made knowne their valour vnto the beholders, yet in the end were forced to withdraw. More couragious warriors had not the King ſéene then thoſe of the Tent, who in leſſe then two houres had ouercome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fiftie knights, beſides the ſtrangers the chiefeſt of the land. Onely now were left, the mightie Gréeke, and <hi>Aſtorildo:</hi> who taking his leaue of the Gréeke (with whom he would not haue no longer quarels) drew forth his ſword and marched towards the Tent. The Prince was moſt ſkilfull in fence, and ſo marked the maner how they kept the
<pb facs="tcp:13978:65"/>
doore, where carefully fixing his eyes, flouriſhing aloft, let flie 2. blows one after an other. They of the Tent, ſtept out toward them, which was to their euill, for he in deſpite of them woon the entrance, whereat ſo many warlike inſtruments were heard, as if ſome generall fielde were to be fought. All the Hall did verily iudge he would win it: for being within, his déeds were incredible, ſo be labouring the Louers, as were he a little vnfortune, <hi>Galtenor,</hi> doubtleſſe he had ſaued <hi>Roſabell</hi> a labour. For one of the Princes (being the beloued) going to wound him below the ſhield, <hi>Aſtorildo</hi> auoiding it, ran at him with ſo ſtrong a thruſt, that hee tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled him bacwards vpon the ſteps that aſcended to the Lady. Being rid of him, he might execute a blowe vpon the others helme, it was with ſuch force, as hee was forced to ſet his knées vppon the ground, run to ouerthrow him he would, which was the loſſe of his battell, for the other abaſhed at his hap, ſtept thither, and with both his hands laid on <hi>Aſtorildos</hi> helme, which made him ſtagger, like to fall.</p>
               <p>An other ſeconded the Competitor, with no leſſe might then that which made him ſet both hands and knées on the earth. They caſt theyr armes about him, and though he a while delayed his vanquiſhment, in the end he was thruſt out, winning more honor then any had before him.</p>
               <p>Now was none left but <hi>Lyrianas</hi> Princely Louer, who riſing from his ſeate with excellent Maieſtie, drew forth that worthie ſworde that once belonged to the mightieſt and greateſt enemie the Gréekes had. There was none, but with admiration gazed on the Brytaine, for his gallant carriage aſſured the victorie. More eyes then <hi>Argos</hi> had, wiſhed the Lady, to cote all his perfections, for ſhe loued him dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then her life. With furious pacing went the Gréeke towards the Pauillion, whence was heard, what neuer was before, for the ſignall as to a battell of ſeuerall armies was ſounded, with many ſhoutes and clamors, that it drowned euery ones hearing. Which being paſt, with more warlike aſpect the two Competitors awaighted their aduerſaries comming: with their ſwords aloft they expected him that with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed courage went neare them: at once they diſcharged 2. migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blowes, yet bigger they muſt be to hinder him the entrance, for with a leap, ere they could again raiſe their ſwords, he ran in betwéen them, and méeting with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnbeloued, with his ſhoulders thruſt him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, fiercer then a bullet ſhot from a muſket. With a thruſt wold the fauorit
<pb facs="tcp:13978:65"/>
wound him, which the Gréek being (ſkilfuller then he) nimbly auoided, and diſcharged his furie on his helme. The enchauntment is vnable to reſiſt the ſharpe edge of <hi>Hectors</hi> blade, for it cut all the top, wounding him a little on the head. Before he could ſettle himſelfe, hee turned vpon the other, giuing him a puiſſant blowe on the ſhield. All that his ſword reached it caſt to the ground, leauing his arme with ſuch extream paine as he could ſcarce ſtir it.</p>
               <p>Excéedingly praiſed in the Hall was the valour of the knight of the Flowers. New baites for <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> that gaue eare to them, with more affection then <hi>Venus,</hi> when ſhe met <hi>Adonis</hi> going to hunt. Yet now hath ſhe no more to giue him, hauing done it all afore, ſaue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie doth ſhee procure to maintaine, wiſhing him a happie victorie, which was to ſome effect, for the Competitors came onely to fight, and thereto do animate themſeleus: but he that was borne in armour will not be daunted with feare, beſtowing neuer a blowe on the Louers, but makes them with hands and knées kiſſe the earth. None doubts the victorie, generally giuing it to the Gréeke, that like a Lyon fought betwéene the Competitors. The vnbeloued thruſt at him ſtrongly with his ſword, thinking to haue runne him thorow, ſo much he made him giue backe, he ſeconded an other, which was trebled with a cruell ſtroke vpon his head by the Fauoured. Something they amazed him, and doubling their blowes againe, made him ſet one knée on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Hold on him to wraſtle would <hi>Beliſas</hi> Louer haue taken, but <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> refuſed it, giuing on his head ſo mightie a blowe, as ſenceleſſe at his féete he caſt him. Swifter doth not an Eagle take her flight, then hée turned vpon the vnbeloued, and twixt his armes he raiſed him aloft, and breathleſſe threw him to the earth. A greater noiſe did not <hi>Illiums</hi> tower make when it fell, then was heard at the Louers fall. Ouercaſt was the Pauillion a while with a thicke fogge, which being paſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as before, ſauing that the knights lay at the Ladies féete, that then ſéemed fayrer, hauing an other Crowne on her head, beſides that ſhe held in her hands. With the ſound of heauenly muſick there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appeared the adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture of Hope, which <hi>Don Eleno</hi> diſcouered at <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clauonia:</hi> and at the Ladies right hand, an old man that was iudged to be <hi>Nycoſtrato.</hi> So ſoone as the knights were vanquiſhed, the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient knight ſaid to <hi>Roſabell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:66"/>Moſt valiant knight, you may highly thinke of your ſelfe, hauing to your immortall glory ended, what in ſo many yeares could neuer bee attained. Now remaines, that the Ladies you leade, by you do prooue the aduenture of the Crownes, and I hope alſo here to ſee it termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Euery one in the hall gréeted the knight of the Flowers, with much ioy: neither expreſt nor thought may that be, which <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, ſéeing what her knight with ſuch honour had obtained, calling her ſelfe a thouſand times happie, for placing her affection on him. The proofe of the Crownes was begun by the ladies, with ſome feare, which notwithſtanding was leſſened by the Knights company. One of the Kings Nieces, a Lady of rare bewtie, taking the Knight by the hand, ſaid.</p>
               <p>I would be ſorie Sir Knight, that through my company you ſhuld looſe what euery one knoweth your valour doth deſerue. That is it I feare (faire Lady) that my vnfortunate hap may debarre me from the honour your bewtie had aſſured. Which being not ſo great as <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas,</hi> made her returne without the Crownes: but with more glorie then any other had got, hauing aſcended to the higheſt ſtep where the Lady ſate. Euery one prooued, yet got little by it. I beléeue (Sir Knight) ſaid the olde man, you haue attained a troubleſome office by vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the two amorous Knights. It is a pleaſure (replyed the Prince) being in ſeruice of Ladies. Now onely remained <hi>Eufroniſa,</hi> fearing ſhe ſhould not obtaine the victorie: iudging the enchaunted Princeſſe to be fayrer, yet euery one was of contrary opinion, although the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian was very faire: but being ſo neare him, ſhe had impreſſed in her ſoule, added bewtie to her bewtie, that when ſhe came to the tents doore ſhe ſéemed <hi>Angelicall.</hi> She was not able, nor could ſhee there other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fauour her gallant, then to wring him by the hand, that if <hi>Lyriana</hi> had not bene poſſeſt of his heart, it had bene no woonder if ſhe there had made him her priſoner. With a moſt ſolemne conſort of melodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, were the two different Louers receiued. Hauing entered the Pauillion, many Nymphes ſtrewed all their way with ſwéete odorious flowers, of whoſe pleaſant ſmell all the hall participated. With more ioy did ſhe mount the ſtaires (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Carthage <hi>Dydo</hi> entred the Caue, where ſhe found her deare <hi>Aeneus</hi>) till ſhe came vnto the top, where the princeſſe <hi>Beliſa</hi> riſing, welcommed her, and taking off her Crowne from her head, ſet it vpon <hi>Eufroniſas,</hi> ſaying. This receiue moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:13978:66"/>
Princeſſe, as a token I acknowledge the ſoueraigntie of your bewtie ouer mine. And in aſſurance of the excéeding loue I muſt beare you, and the extreame paine you ſhall endure, take this at my hands, which if you put on, when moſt you ſhall diſpaire of comfort, this ſhall giue it you, though ſhort and after, paine till death. But what thereby ſhall enſue, ſhall for aye content you. And you moſt glorious knight, though Fortune hath hitherto moſt cruelly perſecuted you, haue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt her chaunges, for you ſhall not return to <hi>Greece</hi> without the thing your ſoule moſt loues.</p>
               <p>The Lady had no ſooner ended what ſhee would ſay, when on a ſudden the Pauillion vaniſhed, onely leauing the beloued Prince in all his iudgement with the Lady. A ſentence was proclaimed, wherby was gathered, that the vnbeloued Lord in recompence of his ſaith, ſo ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed, went to accompany amorous <hi>Celio,</hi> in the Caſtle of Hope. Euery one reioyced therat: for his loue to <hi>Beliſa</hi> merited ſome reward. Who was moſt courteouſly entertained by the King with her beloued Prince, excéeding ioyfull to be at libertie, in company of his Lady, that aſſured his happineſſe with a kinde looke.</p>
               <p>The Ladies intreated the Gréeke to vnlooſe his helme: he refuſed it, till <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> with a wincke did bid him. He obeyed, which more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured the Lady, his bewtie increaſed as much admiration as his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, for being heated by the battel, it was the greater. Some there was that ſaid, it equalled the Ladies, and hauing as yet no beard, and being like his mother, no maruell if it were ſo compared, making the Ladies enuious of his graces. Among them he ſate him downe with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt content he euer receiued, excepting that his Lady gaue him, when ſhe receiued him as her huſband, although hee loſt her at the inſtant. There diſcourſed he with them, ſome demanding who he was, others, whether he was in loue, and others where his Lady was. With ſuch wit, and diſcretion he anſwered them al, as he greatly gained theyr good willes. With her eyes did <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> ſpeake to him, till the nights ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch made him take his leaue of the king, whoſe importunities could not make him ſtay. Softly did the Lady remember him of his promiſe of <hi>Beliſa</hi> and her Louer, he craued leaue, leauing them much bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he demanded of the knight of the Griffon, whether he wold ſtay there or no, for he could do no otherwiſe but depart. So far in loue was <hi>Aſtorildo,</hi> that he anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:67"/>Sir knight, in my ſoule I would be glad of your company, gréeuing that I euer croſt you in your words: but at this time I am forced for a while to abide in this countrey, vntill I bee aduertiſed the contrary from mine: and if in any thing my perſon or what I haue may do you ſeruice, bee aſſured I will performe it with my life. The Gréeke gratefully accepting his offer, departed out of the Pallace, and on his luſtie Courſer went out of the citie, minding being more darker, to returne and kéepe his promiſe. How he accompliſhed it, the next at large relateth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here I haue hitherto implored the fauour of your deſired aid (moſt faire and only worthy to be moſt faire Ladies) to proſecute this ſtorie to record of your fames, the imaginary grant thereof, hauing brought me to this ſtay, doubts his ſufficiencie farther to procéed, vnleſſe it be anew allowed, and ſealed with a pardon, which for your owne ſakes, gentleneſſe and pittie, I hope for my ſelfe I ſhall obtaine, being but the interpreter of my Authors offence, committed by the Gréeke, againſt your ſearch: although it was done by him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by her, to aſſwage the burning fire of <hi>Eufroniſas</hi> loue, and to remooue the deſperate violent paſſions of the ſame. Whoſe reading (oh thinke then how you haue pardoned me) craueth ſuch extenuation, as patiently you will not denie: for his returne will offend your bewties, violating plyted faith to <hi>Lyriana,</hi> by which iniurie, your worthes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but receiue ſome detriment. And ſo comming to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by <hi>Selia,</hi> he left his horſe among the trées, to féede alone mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterleſſe: although he was not long without one, for being ſo good, hee did not little eſtéeme him, that tooke him thence. But <hi>Roſabell</hi> went ſtraight vnto the ladies garden, and knocking at the doore, <hi>Selia</hi> opened it, ſaying.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap> you wold ſo willingly come and obſerue your word, which I may attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to your ſufficient vertues.</p>
               <p>Farre vnworthy of fauour were hee (faire damozell) that would not know what happineſſe by doing it is obtained. Why thou come with me (ſaid ſhe) for Ile commit you to better hands then mine, and ſince you haue this day diſpleaſed me, proouing of the Crownes, do not maruel, if I ſhould put you in ſuch a priſon, as <hi>Iupiter</hi> would not leaue the Empire of the heauens to liue in it. Any thing procéeding from you (gentle Lady) Ile accept as a fauour (anſwered the Gréeke) being aſſured, that ſince you know my will, you will not be againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which I ſhall eſtéeme moſt great, to worke yours. And they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the Ladies lodging, where they were forced to ſilence, leaſt they ſhould be heard, and the Prince tooke off the armor from his legs. So went they euen where <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> did expect him fairer then <hi>Diana,</hi> yet ſo abaſhed and fearefull, that though ſhe ſaw him, yet could not ſpeake. But from her weakeneſſe ſhe drew ſtrength to ſay, embracing him, now Loue began to helpe her. I would not (valiant knight) haue you attribute this my boldneſſe, to more then to requite what I am indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, hauing this day to your high honour, moſt noblely honoured our court, where my ſelfe alſo had part (through your valour) of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end of the aduenture.</p>
               <p>In eternall records of liuing memorie to ſuccéeding ages ſhall this remaine, togither with this my wanton déed, if it be knowne. Hee replied. There nothing happened this day (moſt ſoueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) but was atchieued vnder the name of your excellent bewtie. And therfore, vndergoing it as yours, what difficultie could happen, which I might not vanquiſh, to enternize your glories. Ay me (ſtrange <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano</hi>) were I aſſured thereof, what torment were ſo great, which I ſhould not account a pleaſure and moſt ſwéete. But oh cruell griefe, it is thou that haſt conſpired with my malignant ſtarres, to make mee explaine my will before I know how it will be accepted. Excéedingly content reſted I, ſéeing you at the Fountaine, and conceiued ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that therewith I liue, and euer ſhall poſſeſſe this mancion of my life: but if you knew or would vnderſtand, with what paines &amp; gréefes it was intermixed, there were no heart of Diamond, walled with Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, but would pittie my diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:68"/>She there ended, raining downe her chriſtall rubie chéekes, ſuch a ſhewer of liquid pearle, as it expreſſed her ſoules ſorrow. It was not vnconſidered by the Brittaine youth, for he was M. of Loues ſchoole. A thouſand times curſed he himſelfe, complaining againſt the blinde guidreſſe of vnhappineſſe, reuoluing many inconueniences, the leaſt whereof were woorſe then death: for if he yéeld to the Ladies will, hee ſées the wrong he offers to his <hi>Lyriana,</hi> and if he do it not, hee feares ſhe is reſolued for aye to kéepe him there. Both things hee pondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſely in his minde, yet could not chuſe which he might do, or how to excuſe himſelfe. Notwithſtanding of theſe euils hee tooke the leſſe, yet greateſt, chuſing rather to ſuffer a liuing death, then to offend his deare <hi>Lyriana:</hi> and ſo hee aunſwered contrarie to her expectation thus. I cannot but confeſſe (moſt excellent Princeſſe) how much you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to fauor me, altogither immeritable of your benefits, and if ending the aduenture in your name, may be thought any ſeruice, for euer bee it happie for bringing me to this eſtate, wherein if my woorthleſſe life ſacrificed to confirme your content, may be any ſigne of thankfulneſſe, behold me here readie to yéeld it. With a heauie ſigh the Lady anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Woe be to thée vnfortunate <hi>Eufroniſa,</hi> ſince in thy tendreſt years thou haſte begunne to feele the bitter chaunges of inconſtant Fortune. Sure, ſure I am, I ſhall remaine an example to all poſterities through this vnſéemly act, made woorſe by thy vnciuill vſage. I do not require you cruell knight, nor will not haue you hazard your life in now daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of new enterpriſes, onely I requeſt, ſéeing I loue, (oh Gods that I ſhould ſay ſo) you would do the like. Moſt faire of faireſt Ladies (replied the afflicted youth) I am yours, and as ſuch a one diſpoſe of me, for none with more will ſhall procure your content. But yet doe not beſtow your ſacred faithfull loue on ſo meane a knight as I, both in conditions, blood, and eſtate, the which neither your Princely honour, fame, nor dignitie, doth allow, nor my ſelfe, ſéeing and knowing your looſing choiſe, bound by deſerts vnto your worthineſſe may permit, without infringing the conſtant lawes of faith, hoſpitallitie, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. The which rather then I will commit, theſe my hands will I ſtaine with my owne blood: for where there is ſuch inequallitie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, I ſhould be hated and abhorred of all men, ſo to accompliſh your languiſhing deſire, and therefore haue patience (beauteous Princeſſe) for there is nothing better then it, to tollerate theſe haſtie accidents in Loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:68"/>Oh inhumane crueltie (ſaid the wéeping Ladie) how much doeſt thou extend thy power againſt me? what auailes it thée, hard hearted knight, to procure my honour, by giuing me a moſt vntimely death? So ſhalt thou rather be called an homecide, then a man ſeruitor of Ladies: wel, well I wot, that my ouer liberall giuing thée my heart, mooues thée to this ſtrangeneſſe, knowing there is no reaſon in that breft wher Loue commaundeth: which were it in me, I could not but ſee the increaſe of my honour by being ſilent: but with ſuch vehemencie was my paine augmented, as I could no longer conceale it. And if thou knoweſt what it is to loue, this canſt thou not iudge ſtraunge, when true affection could neuer yet be limitted, and mine excéeding all others, forceth me to ſay: I onely liue to loue thée.</p>
               <p>Héere ſhe pawſed, vnable to procéede further, nor the Prince to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, the one intercepted by the gréefe the poore ſoule indured: and the other, to ſée he cauſed it by being ſo obſtinate and vnrelenting to her requeſts. In the greateſt confuſion of the world was the Prince in, to ſée the Lady, ſo determined and amorous, and he himſelfe be reaft of poſſibilitie to helpe her. I hope moſt beauteous <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> (ſaide the Gréeke) this conceiued anger againſt mee will bee pacified, knowing how long ſince, and afore this time, Tyrant Loue had made mée his tributarie vaſſall, delighting from mine infancie with thoſe that were toucht with this euill, and if the conſideration hereof may mooue you knowing my weakneſſe, to ſatiſfie your deſire, I hope you will deſiſt from making your ſelfe guiltie of diſhonour. Ayme (cruell knight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe) now Ile not ſo much complaine of thy diſdaine, as of my owne lightneſſe, ſéeing what a capitall and hainous crime I haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by committed, not onely gainſt me, (yet that is no matter) but againſt all Ladies in the world beſides, that onely for the name deſerue to bee ſued and intreated. But I (ay mee, that I) as ill accounting of that name, as of my pure honour, haue yéelded to Loues triumph: rather become a ſuter, then reſerue my ſelfe to bee ſued vnto. And yet doo not you thinke, but I perceiue your minde is ſtill buſied, imagining on an others abſence, this and many other things I knowe by experience, ſince I firſt and laſt ſawe you at the fountaine. I do confeſſe it all, and alſo my reputations wracke, but a reſolued mind in conſtancie, cannot leaue lo loue, nor will I otherwiſe, though it treble my ſorrowes eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:69"/>For this I did intreat thy helpe, and for this requeſted thy good will. But for all I am denied all; I wil till death perſiſt in this my pure loue, and hope for no remedie, euermore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining alike of my ſelf, as of thy moſt inhumane barbarous cueltie. And therwith flung out of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, bathing her chéekes in water of her eyes. Shee ſent him by <hi>Selia</hi> ſome Iuncates of her owne making to refreſh him with, for ſhe knew he had eaten nothing all that day. She intreated him to be anſwerable to the Princeſſe loue, though it were but fained, for according to the gréefe that hath poſſeſt her, I doubt ſhe will not liue till morning: and conſider what by her death wil be imputed to you, when you ſhall bee called the murtherer of ſo faire a Lady. I would to God (gentle Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel) ſaid he, it were in my power to redreſſe the Princeſſe griefe: but you know, being heretofore ſworne anothers, it is impoſſible I ſhould plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her, without committing the greateſt fault that euer knight hath none. I wil no more importune you (ſaid the damzell) for I ſhuld think my ſelfe much iniuried with your diſdaine: how much then a Princeſſe ſo faire and honourable. That is it (replied the Gréeke) which hinders me: for ſhould I do what ſhe requires, it were but to ſatiſfie her will a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt mine, which were the greateſt wrong that might bee done her, for hauing pawned my faith vnto another, I cannot violate it to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her.</p>
               <p>The damzel returned to her Ladie, leauing the Prince the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed in the world, ſéeing himſelfe in place where he could not vſe his valor. <hi>Selia</hi> found the beauteous <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> tumbling on her bed, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in teares. What ſayeſt thou my deare <hi>Selia</hi> (ſaid ſhe to her) to the tyrannie wherewith that cruel knight doth vſe me? what meanes may I vſe? I my ſelfe know it not, nor doo thinke there is any? and to deſiſt to loue him, thou ſéeſt is impoſſible: for neither my affection will permit, nor am I able to let it. Shee ſpied neare her the Crownes ſhée had wonne, and with a ſigh that ſéemed to end her life, ſaid. Oh glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rewards to increaſe my harmes, you were the ſole cauſe of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe. Now that ſhe thought the Gréeke to bee in bed, not able to bee quiet, ſhee went alone vnto his chamber, whoſe ſight made the Prince offer quickly to riſe, ſhee ſtayed him, ſaying. Ile not haue thée vſe me with any of theſe ceremonious courteſies, nor is my comming for them (thou cruelleſt knight that euer the heauens did create) but onely do I come, not to intreat of thée what thou ſhouldeſt of thy ſelfe

procure, hadſt thou thy perfect iudgement, ſaue to demand of thée two things, for with either of them ſhal I receiue ſome comfort, and beléeue me, they bee not to thy preiudice, for were they, I would not require them.</p>
               <p>Moſt woorthie Princeſſe, I nothing more deſire of Fortune an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he) then to haue that occaſion offered, wherein I might indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger my life in your ſeruice, and would to God by looſing it, I might cure your woes, then ſhould you ſée with what willingneſſe I would caſt it on a ſquadron of deaths darts: therefore demaund (faire Ladie) what you will, for I wil at the inſtant accompliſh it, beeing with the conditions you propounded. Without them (moſt cruell Knight ſaid ſhe) who durſt require any thing of thee, ſéeing thy ſtraungeneſſe and barbarous diſdaine ſo extreame againſt me. The firſt thing therefore that for me thou muſt do, is, to tell me who thou art, and the Ladies name to whom thou haſt rendred that fréely will of thine? The ſecond thing Ile demaund, this being knowne, for ſéeing I muſt be diſdained and forlorne, I wil know whom I loue, and for whom I am not loued. Your excellencie (ſacred Princeſſe) ſo farre vrgeth this matter, that I cannot thinke (replied <hi>Roſabell</hi>) why you wil know the thing, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne, I am ſure wil but augment your woes. They cannot be greater then them I haue alreadie (did ſhe anſwere) and therefore you muſt not breake with me, vnleſſe you wil be as diſloyal, as cruel.

But will you not (excellent Princeſſe) force mee beeing ſo inraged, to breake that faith I vowed on her hands to be true Louer. And now may you ſée what reaſon mooued me to bee ſo obdurate, finding that any remedie from me, can but diſhonour you.</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible knight (ſaid ſhe) that you are ſonne to the famous knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> whoſe woorthie déeds and loues haue with immortal fame filled all the world, Wel, had I no other cauſe, but that you are ſonne to ſuch a father, it were ſufficient to make mee loue you till death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:70"/>I only intreat your leaue, being alone &amp; oppreſt with theſe extream paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I may diſburthen my cares, by ſéeing the vnhappie <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> is yours, for ſo I ſhall receiue ſome reſt. Whereto he anſwered. Moſt ſoueraigne Ladie, Princeſſe of <hi>Sylepſia,</hi> you ſée what litle power is in me, to graunt you that licenſe, for hauing no intereſt in my ſelfe, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without her will graunt any ſuch thing. Then (ſaide ſhée) tell mée where ſhe kéepes, for Ile ſend to her for it?</p>
               <p>So enuious hath fortune béene to my content, that yet that I cannot ſay, not knowing it, becauſe ſhe reſt her from my hands. Well, well, (replied the Ladie, chopping her words in the middle, and drowning them with teares) becauſe I aſke, I ſée it is impoſſible I ſhould knowe it, leaſt I might receiue ſome little comfort thereby. And ſince the earth cannot affoord me any, the ſecond thing that you for me muſt do, ſince you haue promiſed it, and vowed by the faith of a knight, is, that with this dagger you bereaue me of my deſpiſed life, ſéeing your ſight gaue me ſo many deaths: do not denie it, for you haue promiſed it, and if you do, be ſure Ile trauell through the world, proclaiming your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſhe drew foorth a dagger from vnder her gowne, and with manly courage ſhe put it in his hands, ſaying. Through my breaſt hewe foorth a paſſage for my ſoule (moſt cruell knight) and yet I will not haue you make the wound vpon my heart, leaſt you ſhould hurt your ſelfe, modelde in the middeſt thereof. The Gréeke tooke it, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that he knew not where he was. But the reſolute Ladie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſcouered her breſts, the pureſt work that euer nature wroght. Make an end thou fellon-ſtealer of my libertie, to giue me ſom content by this expected death, and ſtain with blood this conſtant obiect of thine eyes.</p>
               <p>Oh rare force of loue (faire Ladies) whoſe power conſiſting on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, makes all things elſe ſéeme madneſſe, being compared to it. Oh, who would not be mooued, ſéeing the Greeke holding the dagger in his hand, ſitting on his bedde, yet ranging with his thoughts on <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> and the Ladie vrging him to haſten the deadly ſtroke? Oh cruell inexecable knight (ſaid ſhee) wilt thou yet in this torment me? make an end at once, with one ſwéete death to end the many I ſuffer, <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> being the ſole cauſe. In not doing this (moſt Princeleſſe Ladie) I neither commit diſloyaltie (ſaid the Prince) nor breake my word, for
<pb facs="tcp:13978:70"/>
Ile rather looſe my life, then ſpill yours. So excéeding great was the gréef that ſuddainly ſurpriſed her, that ſtopping her breath, and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all her artires and vſuall powers, ſhe fell on the Gréekes breſts. The greateſt proofe of conſtancie was this, that euer knight was tried withall, and had hee continued it, no doubt but the example of it ſelfe had béene a ſufficient memorating marble to record a déed ſo famous. I do not wonder if he beganne ſomething to yéeld, and ioyne his face to hers, (fairer then <hi>Apollos</hi>) halfe reſolued to accompliſh her requeſt. Ere he was fully determined, which wanted but little, ſhee recouered her ſelfe, and ſéeing ſhe was ſo vſed, conceiued an vnhoped ioy, féeling the heate of his chéekes on hers, neuertheleſſe with many ſighes ſhee ſaid. How is it poſſible, tell me knight, thou ſhouldeſt ſtill harbour ſuch crueltie, as ſuffer me to languiſh in ſuch paine, which thou mayeſt remedie by taking away the life I abhorre? That thou wert cruel and inexorable, farre more then <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> beaſts, poore hapleſſe <hi>Eufro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa</hi> knowes it long ſithence by experience. But that thou wanteſt loyaltie and faith to obſerue thy word, who can beléeue it of ſo mightie a Prince? I do confeſſe (faire Princeſſe) anſwered he, I do offend my ſelfe not doing it, yet the offence is greater againſt both, and woorthily I then deſerue the title of a cruell homecide: but that you may not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger complaine of me, grant time till to morrow, to be reſolued in thoſe extreames, and then I will reply to your content. It pleaſeth me (aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe) although one daies ſtay will I feare kill me outright, with this vehement and cruell griefe. But I muſt ſuffer, being borne to doo it, and you diſloyall and faithleſſe knight, conſider well what you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, for ſéeing you haue denied me death, theſe hands ſhall be guiltie of it in your ſight, when your preuention ſhall want ſpéede to ſtay my execution. And thervpon ſhe went away, where had ſhee ſtayed, and once againe vrged it, no longer then that inſtant had béen ynough to anſwere, for the Gréeke reſembled his Grandfather in theſe affaires: he had alreadie pondred the Ladies beautie and her woorthes, in ſuch ſort, that ſome of her diſtilling teares mollifying his obdured heart with ſuch tenderneſſe, that he forgot <hi>Lyriana.</hi> His light vaniſhed with her abſence. With many wiſhes hee deſired the happie appointed night. Little did he ſtriue with his thoughts how to be reſolued, for ere ſhe went away, was the haughtie Brittaine in minde agréed. With more reſt ſtéepes <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> then <hi>Roſabell.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:71"/>Accidents be theſe ordered by the blinde God, vnderſtood of none but him, although the ſoule ſuffers them, and yet cannot he, nor will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by whoſe appoyntment it happens: a iuſt reward for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie, ſince nothing ſhould haue béene able to make him erre againſt his deare <hi>Lyriana,</hi> that with ſuch generoſitie receiued him for her eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>powſe, her Lord and huſband. The Ladie returned glad with the hope of her expected good to <hi>Selia,</hi> and tolde her euerie thing that happened. With ſome content they entertained the expectation of her ioy. By chance, and it was a happie chance, the Ladie tooke one of the crowns that ſhe had wonne in the Tent, and ſet it on her head, it was that which <hi>Beliſa</hi> gaue her, to comfort her in her diſtreſſe. Hauing it on, ſhe ſéemed farre more beautifull, and ſomewhat elder. The vertue of the Crowne beganne his operation. <hi>Selia</hi> was amazed, and plucking her by the arme, ſaid. Bee ſtill (Madame) for ſée the faireſt aduenture in the world, for this Crowne hath power to diſguiſe the face, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue me, you are not like <hi>Eufroniſa.</hi> Peace foole (ſaid the Ladie) it is but Loues deuiſe, and thy wittes conceits. Then do not credit me (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Selia</hi>) but the euidence wherewith I prooue it. So ſhe fetcht her a looking-glaſſe, and ſetting it before her, ſaid. Here (Madame) may you ſée the Crownes effect. She could not but laugh, ſéeing her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance altered, and betwéene them both they iarred, whether ſhe ſo were faireſt or not. Then ſhe remembred <hi>Beliſas</hi> words in the Tent, that there ſhe ſhould finde remedie in her greateſt neceſſitie. Shee could not imagine whoſe ſemblance ſhe repreſented. They would no longer deferre the knowledge of ſo happie buſineſſe: ſo hand in hand they went into a gallerie, called the Ladies Treaſurie, becauſe therein were the pictures of moſt in the world. This was a curioſitie the king for his pleaſure had made. Many they ſawe moſt faire, and they were thoſe that in <hi>Grecia</hi> then flouriſhed: but paſſing further, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their deceit, finding <hi>Lyriana,</hi> whoſe beautie ſhe poſſeſt. They read the title, which tolde them ſhe was Princeſſe of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> to the greateſt ioy that euer <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> did conceiue. Shee embraced <hi>Selia,</hi> ſaying.</p>
               <p>Oh my <hi>Selia,</hi> the heauens now will take my part, for knowe, the Lady that hath captiuated this knight, is ſhe whom I repreſent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on this Crowne: and by this deuiſe, meane I (nothing thanking him) to fulfill my deſire, although he haue promiſed me an anſwere to
<pb facs="tcp:13978:71"/>
morrow. And if I can, with this deceit Ile craue no anſwere, ſéeing it muſt come with ſo many paines and grones. And ſée my <hi>Selia,</hi> how my ſuſpition at the fountaine is verified, that he was not him hee ſaid, for he is ſon vnto the famous knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and betrothed to this Princeſſe, and ſo I thinke I may ſtand excuſed for this my bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Well knew ſhe it, that in the inchanted Tent tolde me, that though therby I ſhould obtain greateſt good, yet would it be intermixt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite troubles. Ioyfully returned the two Ladies vnto their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, expecting the next morne, to deceiue him that was alreadie decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, repenting him of the diſdaine hee ſhewed. The newe crowned Ladie entred his lodging, to giue him the good time of the day. The Gréeke had ſcarce ſéene her, when falling in the deceipt, he tooke her to bee <hi>Lyriana,</hi> and with great tenderneſſe he ran to her, ſaying. May it be deare Ladie, that in time of ſuch ſorrow you would be pleaſed to glad my heart with your preſence. How ill ſhould I requite your loue deare Lord (ſaide the miſtaken Ladie) if I did not procure your content, being able as at this time, and though I be with you, yet none knowes of it.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke Louer embraced her, thinking he enioyed his <hi>Lyria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> companie, which made <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> moſt glad to ſée the effect of the pleaſant deceit. What happened by this méeting, is left to honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Onely <hi>Galtenor</hi> ſaith, the Ladie forgot her paines, enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many daies the fruition of the Gréeke Louers bedde vnder that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, telling him that a wiſe man her great friend, had for ſome time fetcht her out of the inchantment, to accompany him in that diſtreſſe. Much bound did the Prince thinke himſelfe to him for ſo good a turne. So farre wrought the vertue of the Crowne, that all the time ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed him by that deceit, the Gréeke could comprehend no more, but tooke what Fortune offered him.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> iudging it reaſon to let him go, féeling her ſelfe with childe, conferred with <hi>Selia</hi> that approoued it. Shee tooke off the Crown, kiſſing it a thouſand times, for hauing enioyed by it her harts content. She had no ſooner ſet it by the other, when it was preſently taken away, not knowing by whoſe hands.</p>
               <p>A voyce ſhée heard, which thus comforted her. Haue patience Ladie, for the heauens will haue it ſo, and till you knowe
<pb facs="tcp:13978:72"/>
the fruite that by this deceit ſhall riſe, neuer looke to ſée it more.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as it was taken away, the Gréek thought all that he had paſt but a dreame, hauing ſcarce the remembrance thereof. What time hée had ſo ſpent he knew not, but ſtayed for the Ladies comming to giue her his anſwere, which ſhee determined to refuſe, becauſe ſhee would not be bound vnto him for it. She entred his chamber with her dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, thus ſpeaking. How are you determined (moſt cruell knight of the <hi>Flowers</hi>) that according to your reſolution, ſhe may liue that loues you. He anſwered. I am ſure (excellent Princeſſe) you haue had time to conſider the wrong you do me, to inforce me breake my word: yet I am yours, and will bee till the death, and ſo may you diſpoſe of mee at your pleaſure. Whereto ſhe thus returned. Euer ſince (moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince of <hi>Greece</hi>) that Fortune or the powers of Loue made my heart obedient to your will, I onely procured but a graunt from your mouthe, by ſo many meanes as you haue ſéene, ſolely deuiſed to affect you, and that you might knowe I loue you. And ſince you are aſſured thereof, and now to comfort my ſorrowes in your abſence, I wil haue you leaue with me ſome remembrance, and let it be your dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for which you ſhal haue mine, that wherewith I intreated you to end my life, which now Ile kéepe to imploy it in your loue: and beléeue me (braue Prince) while this ſoule ſhal haue power to breath, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall neuer decay.</p>
               <p>And therewith, with excéeding ioy ſhe embraced him, and taking his ponyard, ſhe gaue him hers, bidding him prepare his departure againſt the next morning. The Prince did ſo, ſomewhat abaſhed to haue béen ſo importuned. Hee tooke his leaue of the Ladies not without many teares, for truſt mee, hee was beloued in the higheſt degrée that euer knight was. A verie rich Iewell the Ladie gaue him at his departure. All armed in precious armour, and mounted on a luſtie Courſer, giuen him by <hi>Eufroniſa,</hi> hee went out of the famous Cittie of <hi>Golthuerge,</hi> whoſe departure ſhe tooke moſt heauily: yet ſome comfort ſhe conceiued to be big with childe by him.</p>
               <p>Straight the two Ladies beganne to deuiſe how they might kéepe cloſe <hi>Eufroniſas</hi> trauell, who being a ſtraunger to ſuch matters, grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereat. Onely this conſolation ſhe tooke, to looke from the toppe of a high turret towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> whither her ioy was gone, calling it a heauie land to bring forth ſuch fruite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:72"/>Thus this bewtious Lady paſſed away the ſeaſon vntill her time of deliuerie, which being the firſt, ſhe felt extreamely. She was deliuered of two boyes, the faireſt that the heauens created: for he which was firſt brought forth, had on the face of a Lady, fairer then the ſunnes Splendor in his pride. The other a heart thruſt through with a dagger, with the wound ſo freſh as it ſéemed then to bléed. <hi>Selia</hi> ſhewed them her, ſaying. Reioyce faire Princeſſe, with the iſſue ſprung from that deceit, which is ſuch, that it frées you from any fault. The tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embraced and kiſt them, ſaying. Oh, may the powerfull heauens deare children of my heart, let you liue to know your warlike father: for though he vſed me with all crueltie, yet are you his ſonnes. Bleſſe you may the Gods, &amp; make you as happie as I am vnhappie, although I may now call my ſelfe the happieſt on the earth, onely by being your mother. So carefull <hi>Selia,</hi> tooke them away, and through a ſecret doore in the garden, ſhe gaue them to the old ancient knight, to ſee them nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſome Village. At their carriage away, a thouſand kiſſes and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings did the louing mother giue them, as diuining the long time ſhee ſhould be ere againe ſhe ſaw them.</p>
               <p>With much care did the olde knight carrie them to a Village, where he had prepared a nurſe for them. That hee might paſſe more couertly, he croſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Forreſt, bearing the children in two baſkets on a litle Aſſe, by the way hee reſted, and tooke downe the boyes to quiet them from crying. Scarce had he done, when a chaſed Lyon ran thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being hunted by ſhéepheards, with their dogs. The knights age and the Lyons ſight, put him in ſuch feare as he fell downe in a trance. As then the cruel beaſt ment not to take any pray, but to eſcape his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers.</p>
               <p>In this manner lay the old man and the children crying for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when by great chaunce a mightie Lord dwelling on the confines of <hi>Sylepſia,</hi> paſt that way with his wife, that had bene at the Cittie to to ſée the tryumphes there. With them was an auncient Lady, lately deliuered of a childe, that dyed in <hi>Golthuerge.</hi> So ſoone as the Lords wife ſaw the children, and hauing none her ſelfe, tooke ſuch affection on the babes, ſéeing theyr woonderfull bewtie, that ſhe commaunded the other Lady carefully to nurſe and bring them vp.</p>
               <p>In this manner were theſe two Infants carried by this Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:73"/>
and tendered as his owne. He that had the Ladies face, they named <hi>Clarabell.</hi> And the other with the wounded heart, <hi>Leobello.</hi> Who ſo grew in yeares and bewtie, that they were accounted children of the Godds.</p>
               <p>Where we will leaue them, nouriſhed by the good Knight <hi>Sergio,</hi> for ſo was hee called, omitting alſo their afflicted mothers ſorrow for theyr loſſe: and a while muſt remember the mightie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring knight <hi>Claridiano</hi> of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> already departed from <hi>Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or a while (faire Ladies) I am conſtrained to leaue Loues amorous diſcourſes, and truſt mee, with ſome gréefe: but hauing to treate of many things, I muſt deſcribe them with diuers ſtyles. And now the warlike Gréeke, with an Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue power, attrackts me to lighten him from the darke center of obliuion: who departing from the moſt bewteous <hi>Venus,</hi> and gallant <hi>Layſa,</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into the Adriaticke ſea, downe the which, hee Nauigated foure dayes: and the fift, hee croſſed into the Affrican, and happening on no aduenture deſeruing memorie, he put into the Carpachian and Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſeas: where ſayling ſome fiftéene dayes, his enchaunted Barke ran it ſelfe on land, in the Ile of <hi>Creete,</hi> (now <hi>Candy</hi>) the happieſt and fertileſt in all thoſe partes, becauſe <hi>Ioue</hi> was borne and raigned there.</p>
               <p>A ſhore leaped he and <hi>Paliſandro</hi> his Squire, and landed theyr horſes. The commoneſt way that they could iudge, they tooke, and did ride aboue an houre, méeting with none to learne in what land they were. Vnder a high Pyne they diſmounted to reſt and paſſe the heate of the afternoone, eating of ſuch prouiſion as <hi>Paliſandro</hi> had carried from the Barke.</p>
               <p>The pleaſantneſſe of the countrey much delighted the Prince,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:73"/>
although it was ſuch little comfort to the paines he ſuffered, that were it not for <hi>Paliſandros</hi> conſolations, hee had without doubt run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue dangers.</p>
               <p>As he ſat downe, certaine ſhéepheards came that way, driuing their flocks to féed on the downes, belowe a hillocke neare to that place. They told him, how he was in the famous Ile of <hi>Creet,</hi> of which hee had heard ſo many things. It much pleaſed him, to heare the ſhéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards name the aduenture of the thrée Pypes: for though hee had heard thereof, he neuer knew it to be in <hi>Creete:</hi> to bee aſſured thereof, he demanded of them thus. Can you tell me diſcréete ſhéepheards, the beginning of this aduenture? who made it, and for whom? That which now is ſaid thereof (Syr Knight) is, that not many yeares ſince, this aduenture appeared here, where (it is ſaid) there is onely one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſeſt Princes of the world inchaunted: whoſe ſtrength is alſo giuen out farre to excéede <hi>Theſeus,</hi> ſo celebrated in this Ile, for killing of the <hi>Minotaure.</hi> So difficult is the entrance to the Fountaine, called of the thrée Pypes, that none, though many mightie knights pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, haue arriued thither. Onely there is one entrance, ſo ſurely guarded, as it is thought impoſſible to paſſe that way by force of armes, all the reſt is immured with ſo high a wall of ſtones, cut ſo ſmoothe, that there is no aſcending nor entrance, but through the difficult paſſage, which is a little beneath your hill. I do greatly thanke you (kind ſhéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards) for your courteous relation, and will requite it in any thing I may.</p>
               <p>So they went away, leauing him conferring with his ſquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the proouing thereof, for he much deſired to know the Prince that was within. The ſquire would not gainſay it, knowing his valor ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for greater matters.</p>
               <p>Then hauing a while reſted, they followed the ſhéepheards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, within a little time they came in ſight of the ſtupendious Edefice. Neuer before had the Prince ſéene a thing more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy admiration then it: for it ſéemed to checke the moſt higheſt Clowdes. The paſſage to it, was along a faire Valley, a ſtones caſt in length, whoſe entrance was through a Lane of mightie trées, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable thicke branches ioyning togither, did well declare the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult paſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:74"/>Without any feare <hi>Trebatios</hi> haughtie Nephew arriued thither, not far fro the Groue that leaded to the Fountaine, of which the aduenture tooke his name. The breadth of the way that the Prince went, would ſuffer but ſir knights to go it togither: the which, as one prepared to the fight, the mightie youth traced. So comming to the end of the Lane where the Vallies entrance began, he was not ſo amazed with the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell he had againſt the helliſh beaſt at <hi>Merlins</hi> ſepulchre, as ſéeing here one of the fearefulleſt winged Serpents that might be. He ſtayed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to bethinke him by what meanes hee might combat with the vgly monſter. In the end he reſolued to be beſt on foote, the better to vſe his nimbleneſſe and weapons, ſo did he diſmount, giuing <hi>Paliſandro</hi> his horſe, and taking his Lance in his hand, and with his heart in heauen, he marched towards the infernall monſter: the which ſéeing him come, ſtretched her ſelf on the ground, and raiſing halfe her body, hiſſing fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, crept againſt the Gréeke, who with that diſcréetneſſe he vſed in all his affaires, ſetling himſelfe ſtrongly on his left leg, hurled his Launce at her. Vpon her inpenitrable ſcales wherewith ſhe was armed, it fell, rebounding backe as if it had lighted vpon a Rocke. Neuertheleſſe, it made her bend her head as lowe as the ground. With a nimble leape he got within the beaſts Cabbin, where there began ſuch hideous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, that he was about a thouſand times to turne backe, but iudging it baſe cowardiſe, with his ſword drawne he expected the ſerpents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Neuer was that Ile witneſſe of a more brauer Combat. In it the Gréekes dexteritie auailes him, for the edge of his ſword can make no impreſſion in her. He found it, when at his firſt aſſault, he gaue her a mightie blowe on the ſcales. Whipping the earth with her taile, came the furious Serpent againſt the Gréeke youth: and being neare him, with her mouth he would haue hoyſed him aloft: he defended himſelfe ſtepping aſide, ſo ſcaping her clawes, but not her taile, wherewith ſhee gaue him ſuch ayerke, that ſhe floong him farre without the entrance he had woon.</p>
               <p>More furious then ſhee ryſed the Gréeke <hi>Hercules</hi> bruiſed with the fall, and with haſtie paces hee ranne againe vnto the entrance, but there hee founde the Serpent. Feareleſſe, the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Gréeke approached to her, holding his ſword ſure betwéene his hands. He had ſcarce made an offer, when the diuelliſh furious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſnatcht at his ſhield with one of her fangs, dragging him thereby,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:74"/>
within her inchaunted pale, vntill ſhe brake the girts. It gréeued not the Prince to be there, nor yet to haue loſt his ſhield, but with his ſword in both hands, ſtayed for her that furiouſly came flying to him; ſhe ſtretcht forth her paw to take him with her ſharpe clawes. With much héed the Prince expected her, and being neare, with a flouriſh, he gaue her a moſt ſtrong blowe. It was venturous, and that which gaue him the victorie. For diſcharging it very neare her breaſt, where the ſcales were not ſo hard, it mortally wounded her. No helliſh furie is now compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her being wounded, for ſtriking the earth, ſhe flew to the Gréeke, whoſe courage and ſtrength could not now defend him from her tayle: for therewith ſhe ſtrook him to the ground, where alſo he could not ſcape her tallents. His armor ſaued his life, though ſome of the ioynts ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fleſh. The Gréeke in this extremitie forgot not his dagger, which drawing forth with his left hand, he ſtabbed it thriſe vnder her necke, with which wounds ſhe let him go. But ſhe had no ſooner done it, when ſhe returned vpon him, opening wide her infernall mouth. He ſtrongly held his left arme, and holding the point of his dagger vpwards, he ran it into her mouth, whereon ſhe thinking to pray, twixt her iawes, ſhee thruſt it into her braines. With ſome trouble the Gréeke drew it forth, glad of the good ſucceſſe: yet before he got cleare, or that ſhe fell, with her taile ſhe gaue him the laſt yerke, in ſuch manner, that had ſhe bene able to ſecond an other, he had bene in great daunger. He fell on the ground, voiding much blood through his mouth. The like to that the Gréeke Louer neuer had receiued. He roſe, becauſe careleſly he would not looſe what his valour aſſured. And ſaw the ſerpent weltring in her owne goare, till by little and little ſhe dyed, to the Gréekes excéeding content: who to reſt, ſate him downe vnder a loftie oake that grew in the end of that Lane, and tooke off his helme to take the ayre, that then freſhly blew. On the bark of the Oake he ſaw a ſcrowle, which he read thus.</p>
               <q>To thee Knight, whom Fortune hath ſo fauoured, as ouercomming the feareful keeper of the entrance vnto the three Pyped Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to let thee here arriue to reſt, haue courage, for it muſt ende what yet doth want.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:75"/>The words did not ſo much feare him, as the doubt whether hee ſhould haue to do with knights on whom he might better ſhew his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Long would not <hi>Archyſiloras</hi> Louer reſt, for preſently riſing he tooke his ſhéeld, and caſting it at his backe, went downe the Valley. Great comfort did hee receiue with the byrds ſwéete harmony that welcommed him, where <hi>Philomelas</hi> ſad complaints increaſed his, and the Larkes ſwéete ſong (the mornings Herault) eaſed his trauell. A more pleaſanter place the Prince had neuer ſéene, for beſides the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Tapeſtry, the diuerſitie of all manner of frutefull trees were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and in ſuch order placed, that Nature miſtreſſe of inuention, ſéemed there to ſtriue with Art (the adorner of her wants) for ſoueraigntie.</p>
               <p>Euery thing the prince conſidered not, omitting the dear remembrance of his ſoules commandreſſe, fayre <hi>Archyſilora.</hi> He made ſuch haſte, that about the ſecond houre after mid-day, hee arriued to the famous Fountaine, whoſe proud making, much amazed him. For the Pypes through which the water ran, were thrée mightie ſauages, cut in Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſter, whiter then the ſnowe (vppon the Appenines) all guilded and inamelled. Vnder the thrée pypes was a faire great Ceſterne, where ſhe little byrdes flew to drinke. Before it ſtood a brazen Piller with this inſciption.</p>
               <q>The vnknowne Caſtle ſhall be ſeene by none, vntill the diſpayring Lyon, freeing the paſſage to his owne bloods coſt, ſhall arriue vnto this Piller: where to paſſe forward, he muſt leaue heere ſome peece of his Armor.</q>
               <p>The Prince a good while doubted which it ſhould be. In the ende he reſolued to leaue his ſhéeld. He hung it on the Piller, and ſtraight went on, diſcouering before him the ſtately buildings, ſo high, that they ſéemed to reach vnto the middle region of the ayre, it was all ſo couered with Golde, that it ſcarce admitted any ſight. There was but one doore, the which the Prince found faſt locked, whereat with the pummell of his ſword he knocked very hard. At the noyſe, a window opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the gate, out of which there looked a Lady all in Armor, ſauing the head. The ſight aſtoniſhed the Gréeke, thinking it was <hi>Archyſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who with ſome anger, ſaid. What ſéeke you (audacious Knight) for none may enter here, but that liues to loue without hope? halfe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:75"/>
the Prince anſwered. I do confeſſe, how I offend you (moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi>) by demanding a reward for my faith ſacrificed to thy gallantneſſe: but yet if with death or endleſſe diſhonor you will ſtill be reuenged on me, appoint the manner of the vileſt death you can, and I will bee hee that ſhall moſt willingly performe that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>It is well knight (replyed the Lady) now you haue committed a fault, you thinke by confeſſion to extenuate your deſcrued puniſhment. So ouercome with contemplation of his Lady ſtood the Gréeke, that he heard not the opening of the gate, with as much horror, as if a peale of ordinance were diſcharged. Through it, came foorth two Knights richly armed: and alſo after them, followed the bewteous <hi>Claramant,</hi> apparelled in cloath of Golde, whoſe preſence would haue made <hi>Narciſſus</hi> leaue his ſelfe-loue to ſtay and dote on him.</p>
               <p>Hauing their Launces in their reſts, and as ſwift as the winde, they ran againſt the careleſſe Prince, that was buſied gazing on his beloued <hi>Archyſilora.</hi> So valiant were his two aduerſaries, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to hit him, that they loſt not their encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, which were ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſudden, that when he would haue warded them, hee found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the ground, ſo ſore bruſed with the fall, that he could not riſe when he would. So eager is not an Eagle to defend he yoonglings, as the Knights turned vpon the Prince, and both at once againe hit him, but being warned by the former negligence, ſtoutly reſiſted them, that they could not ouerthrowe him, but made him ſtagger backwards. So ſkilfull were the Knights of the Caſtle, that the one ſéeing the ill ſucceſſe of their encounter, like a ſecond <hi>Mars,</hi> flung his Lance at him. He miſt him: for in the middeſt of his amorous breſt, hee gaue him the greateſt blow that euer he receiued, and was forced to ſtay himſelf with his left hand on the ground. Neuer before did the Prince iudge himſelfe in more danger, ſéeing the knights ſo actiue and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>They could not ſo preuaile with their dexteritie, but the Gréeke with his, reached him that hurled his Lance, ſuch a blow, that ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee ſtrooke him on his horſe necke. Hee ran to plucke him down, but he was ſtayed in the attempt: for the other knowing hee could not come in time to reſcue him, ſetled himſelfe on his ſtyrrops,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:76"/>
and out of his arme let his Lance flie, like a killing Comet: it ſtrooke him on the one ſide of the cloſing of his armor, where <hi>Galtenor</hi> ſaith, it wounded him a litle: but <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> affirmeth, he was felled to the earth, yet howſoeuer he could not performe his attempt: for all he much procured it. Now the two companions being ſpeareleſſe, drew foorth two ſwords vnequalled in all the world, and with them arriued vpon the Gréeke, that expected them: A flooriſh diſcharged one vppon his helme, which he gréeuouſly felt, and the other ſomewhat lower thruſt at him fiercely: which hee dearely did aby: for <hi>Claridiano</hi> more furious then thundering lightning, auoided it ſtepping aſide, leauing him han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vpon his horſe. Thinking to haue ſlaine him, with both hands he laid on his ſhoulders. The Prince imagined he had cleft him in the middeſt, but he could not be vanquiſhed on horſebacke: who therefore returned with more courage then before, and began to helpe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Prince, with ſuch ſtrength and lightneſſe, as he thoght himſelfe in manifeſt danger, doubting the euent of the battell. So one aſſaulted him with his Courſers ſwifteſt courſe, which carreir he loſt: for <hi>Archiſiloras</hi> Louer a little yéelding ſidewaies, caſt his ſtrong arms about him, and maugre all his forces, pulled him from his ſaddle to the ground, much glad therof, for ſo he might better deale with them. Who were ſo inſtructed to aide one an other, that he which was on foot, wold neither looſe nor ſtep from <hi>Claridiano,</hi> till he ſaw his companion run at him, and then with a ſwinge hee turned him againſt the horſe breſt, who encountred him ſo ſtrongly, that he made him ſtumble backwards like to fall.</p>
               <p>And more to helpe him downe, he on foote thruſt at him in his amaze, two ſuch ſtrong points, that <hi>Claridiano</hi> neuer did what he was now inforced vnto, for neither courage nor valoure preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he fell downe. But like <hi>Anteus</hi> towching on the earth, he roſe freſher and fiercer, that he on horſbacke eſcaped not frée for his encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for as he turned, <hi>Claridiano</hi> as wrathfull as a hungrie Lyon, let driue at him with ſo puiſſant a blowe, that whether he would or no, hee felde him from his Saddle downe to the graſſie plaine: where it added pleaſure to content, ſéeing the fortunate and vnconquered Gréeke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and retire as he would. Wearied he had them, although himſelfe was no leſſe: for they of the Caſtle were of the valianteſt in the world, and about that matter, would not refuſe <hi>Mars</hi> his challenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:76"/>Croſſing his ſword inwards, the one aſſaulted the Gréeke, it was but an offer, for going toward it, he ſtayed his arme, and bearing it lower, ſtrooke him on the legs, and on the left thigh he gaue him the greateſt blow that he had receiued in all that battle: for though it did not wound him, yet it put him in ſuch paine that he could not ſtir that legge. The good effect of the ſtroke, perceiued they of the Caſtle, and that they might take the aduantage, before the paine left him, they began to hammer him with more ſtrength and ſpéede, then the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> did when they forged <hi>Aeneas</hi> Armor. The Prince much feared being ſo lame, but ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it concerned him no leſſe then his life, dragging that legge, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wonders.</p>
               <p>The firſt Battle that euer <hi>Claramant</hi> had ſéene was this: the which he iudged to himſelfe would be the laſt, ſo fierce and terrible it was. He ſaid, more cunning ſkill nor vallour could not be wiſhed in one knight, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what he in the yallow ſhewed. It was a matter worthy the Prince, for as he was, he neuer ſuffered them to cloſe within him, though they nothing elſe procured, ſtil kéeping them out with his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable cruell blowes, which made them kiſſe the earth, ſometimes with their hands, and then with their knées. And againe other times, all at once.</p>
               <p>In the ende he flung at him that had wounded him: quicke he was, but <hi>Archyſiloras</hi> Champion was poſſeſſed with extreameſt of his rage, and therefore reached him on the toppe of his Helme, in ſuch manner, that in deſpight of him, he tumbled him on the gréene breſt of his mother earth. At him with a thruſt ranne the other, which <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi> ſtriking aſide, hée ſtrooke him with both handes on his armes, that he could no more vſe his ſword. Hee cloſed with him, and hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him from the ground, flung him downe on his backe, neare where his Companion was. Vppon them with his naked Dagger buſſeled the Louer: for hauing exceedingly incenſed him, he forgot the pitie and accuſtomed clemency which he vſed towards his vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>Before him ſtept the bewteous <hi>Claramant,</hi> ſaying. To ende a Combat with death (moſt valiant knight) whoſe conqueſt is ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, wil rather blemiſh the Victors victorie, then dignifie his fame: Wherefore I pray you, giue me thoſe Knights as by you are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:77"/>The haughtie Gréeke lifted vp his head to anſwere him, for through the anger of the fight, he had not noted the <hi>Donzell.</hi> So looking on him now, he was aſtoniſhed, thinking he ſawe himſelfe: for were hée a litle elder, none could haue diſtinguiſhed them, nor yet from the Emperour <hi>Alphebo,</hi> for they reſembled ſo much one another, that in the beginning he verily iudged him to be his father, which opinion his tender yeares fruſtrated. And yet ſuppoſing him ſome kinſman of his, did graunt it, and would haue done had it bene farre more. But that was inough, had he bene any other then <hi>Claridiano,</hi> to make him neuer returne to <hi>Greece.</hi> For ſcarce had the <hi>Donzell</hi> rayſed them with his hand, when as freſhe as in the beginning, they let flie at him, togither two ſuch blowes, that they made him knéele on the ground.</p>
               <p>It extreamly gréeued him to be ſo mocked, yet was not he angry againſt the <hi>Donzell,</hi> imagining through lacke of iudgement he had done it. He animated himſelfe to this new Combat, although with ſome doubt to ſée his aduerſaries nimbler and luſtier then at the firſt, and himſelf ſomewhat weary. Claſping his ſword ſtrongly in his hand, he went againſt them, making them knowe, nothing could bereaue him of his aſſured victorie. So cloſing with the one, with his ſhoulders he thruſt him from him, like a looſened arrow from a bowe. And with a leape he turned on the ſecond. His ſpéed could not ſaue him, for the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Greeke cut away halfe his helme, with part of his head. This blow gladded him, reſoluing to deny the <hi>Donzell</hi> any thing he ſhould aſke within that place. By this arriued the other, but what auailes it, for the Greeke <hi>Mars</hi> giues no blowe which they féele not within their fleſhe. They had kinde Ladies in this ſecond fight loſt the vertue of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, only helping themſelues with their natural ſtrength, which was very great. And yet it preuailes not againſt him that was borne a Conqueror.</p>
               <p>End this cruel warre would the Gréeke, calling himſelfe coward to prolong it ſo long: And auoyding one of their blowes, he ran at him with the braueſt thruſt that in all his life he executed: for piercing ſhield, breaſt and backe, hée tumbled him dead at his féete, to <hi>Claramants</hi> great admiration. The ſecond incouraged himſelfe for all he was alone and ſore wounded, it was but a little lengthning of his life, to endure a more cruell death. For the Prince hauing Fortune by the Front,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:77"/>
ſtrooke at the top of his helme, yet not with the ſtrength he might, but he yéelding backe his head, couered it with the ſhielde: whereat the Gréeke turning his arme, diſcharged it on his thighes ſo mightily, that almoſt he cut one cleane off. Before he could ſetle himſelfe, he ran vpon him, and with incredible haſte (leaſt <hi>Claramant</hi> ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him) he reaft him of his life: himſelfe remaining ſo wearie, that his legges could not then ſuſtaine him.</p>
               <p>All his life time he moſt eſtéemed this victorie, for it coſt more labor, more blood, and more trouble, then any other of that quallitie. He went towards the beauteous Donzell, elder then him by ſixe yeares, but hauing ſuffered no cares, nor paines, nor loue paſſions, made him ſéeme yonger then his couſin: who tooke off his helme, diſcouering that <hi>Mars</hi> his countenance of his. Either reioyced to ſée the other, thinking they ſawe one another in a glaſſe. So <hi>Claridiano</hi> ſpake firſt, ſaying. I intreat you (faire Donzell) ſo the heauens make you happie in all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, to tell me the cauſe of your being within ſo defended a place, and alſo who you are? for conſidering how dearly your ſight hath coſt me, (although I thinke it well beſtowed) you are bound to tell me: whereto <hi>Claramant</hi> replied.</p>
               <p>Of neither (ſir knight) may I reſolue you, vnleſſe I receiue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chiualrie, and in faith it not a little gréeues mee, that I cannot herein ſatiſfie you. Such deſire had the Gréeke to know him, as hée was determined to giue it him: but remembring how hee was before mocked, thus anſwered. Nay ſir, if your knowledge muſt coſt ſo much, I will not more wiſh it, for in not performing as yet your requeſt, I am ſure I do you ſome ſeruice. Why then (ſaid <hi>Claramant</hi>) fare you well, for Ile returne vnto my Caſtle, and in faith, ſorrie to bée denied in my firſt requeſt I euer made to any knight. Go with me from hence (woorthie Donzell, returned the Gréeke) and you ſhall receiue it with ſuch ſolemnitie, as is due vnto your perſon. The gallant youth anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, but in great haſte returned to the Caſtle, where had hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, his couſin had not béene able to haue fetcht him thence, for béeing with armes, none of all his kinſmen did excell him. But the wiſe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato</hi> knowing it concerned his ſonne <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> with his charmes and exorciſmes, clowded with miſts and fogges all thoſe ſhining buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, ſo aſtoniſhing the Donzel, that thinking to enter the Caſtle, hée miſt his way, and tooke it towardes the Fountaine of the thrée pypes, where being a drie, and hearing the waters running noyſe, he dranke.
<pb facs="tcp:13978:78"/>
But hee had ſcant toucht it, when ſuch horribible and hideous noyſe was heard, that <hi>Claramant</hi> was halfe afraide. The ende of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture conſiſted on <hi>Claramants</hi> arriuing to the fount, to take downe the ſhield which his couſin had hung on the piller, on condition of his paſſage.</p>
               <p>So all that mightie edefice vaniſhed away, made by the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitian <hi>Lirgandeo,</hi> as the ſecond part related, wherein hee had inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this valiant Prince, when he tooke him from the barbarous <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> that belonged to <hi>Bramarant,</hi> who ſtole him from his mother in the woods of <hi>Grecia,</hi> as in the third booke of the firſt part is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Alone did the Gréeke finde himſelfe in a broad field, and <hi>Paliſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> by him with the horſes. So looking for the <hi>Donzel,</hi> he ſpied him in great haſte entring into a thicke wood of trées, that ſtood in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. He roſe and went thither, at ſuch time as <hi>Claramant</hi> onely with his ſhield, had thruſt himſelfe within, whoſe ſight he quickly loſt. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him hee would, but it was in vaine, for a ſtrong contrarie winde blew him out, where he was forced to expect the ſucceſſe of that aduenture reſerued to the <hi>Donzel.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithin the intricate groue (ſwéete Lady) wee left the <hi>Donzel Claramant,</hi> whoſe diſinchauntment being excéedingly deſired of euerie one, made mée (to pleaſe thoſe deſires) a breuiate the preſedent combats, although <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> doth not a little inlarge his diſcourſe therin. But my ſelfe wiſhing no leſſe his inlargement, then any other, forced me to enter him with ſuch breuitie, within the way-confuſed wood, wherein hauing loſt himſelfe, <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thrée daies alone, onely with the Greekes ſhield. This was that crooked intricable mancion, in whoſe contriuing, <hi>Dedalus</hi> at <hi>Minos</hi> petition, king of <hi>Greece,</hi> did ſhew the ſharpneſſe of his ſkill and witte, wherein the famous <hi>Minotaure</hi> was incloſed: whoſe originall ſprung
<pb facs="tcp:13978:78"/>
from ſhe beaſtly blinde loue of <hi>Paſiphae</hi> the Quéene, for the king bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed in the Troyan warres, ſhe with inhumane appetite lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after a white bull, that was among her heards: and not knowing how to accompliſh ſo foule a déede, ſhee recommended it to <hi>Dedalus:</hi> who with his wit, being the Oracle of his age, contriued an artificiall Cowe of wood, wherin he put the Queene, couered with the hyde of another which the Bull moſt followed, by which meanes ſhe ſatiſfied her luſt, ingendring the <hi>Minotaure</hi> which the Poets faine: and yet <hi>Arſanio</hi> in the fourth of his Problemes, approoues with wonderfull arguments, the poſſibilitie of the act: and ſaith that at the time of the monſters birth, returned the king, who would not, althogh the Quéen died of the labour kil the beaſt, but rather commanded him to be kept in a place moſt difficult to come foorth, reſeruing him there, for what hée further intended. For making cruell warre vpon the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of his ſonne <hi>Androgeus</hi> death, whom they flew, hee compelled them in ſatiſfaction thereof, yearely to ſend him ſeuen men, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maides, to be deuoured by the <hi>Minotaure.</hi> Whoſe forme was both of man and Bull, and of proportionable bigneſſe. For ſome few yeares laſted this cruell cuſtome, vntill <hi>Theſeus</hi> comming, whoſe ſtrength was nothing inferior to <hi>Hercules,</hi> in ſo much, that ſome will haue him to be he.</p>
               <p>Being young, he ayded <hi>Hercules</hi> againſt the <hi>Amazones,</hi> whom after they had conquered, he married their Quéenes ſiſter. He ſlew the Tyrant of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that would not burie his dead kinſmen. And in the <hi>Marathonian</hi> fields hee ſlewe the wilde Bull that waſted all <hi>Attica.</hi> This was hee that rauiſht <hi>Helena</hi> the firſt time, whoſe tender age might then well acquit her of the error. Hee deſcended into hell with <hi>Perithons,</hi> to ſteale <hi>Proſerpyne,</hi> where he loſt his friend. This by lot was ſent to <hi>Creete</hi> as food vnto the <hi>Minotaure.</hi> But the beauteous <hi>Ariadne</hi> affecting the youth, gaue him a clue of thread, which ſhould (after he had ſlaine the beaſt) lead him out.</p>
               <p>He ingratefully requited both her loue and life good turne, leauing her alone in <hi>Nioſia</hi> Ile, which act of vnthankfulneſſe ſo gréeued the moſt wiſe <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that he inchanted him in the laborinth, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his ingratitude, ſuffering eternall paines yet to fewe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his deſerts. He more inlarged the mazed houſe, that his libertie might be more difficulter. The which he made ſo ſinguler, as at the
<pb facs="tcp:13978:79"/>
leaſt it equalled that in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and far excelling king <hi>Porſenas</hi> which he builded in <hi>Italie</hi> for his ſepulchre: which was ſo fearefull, that hee commaunded before he dyed, he ſhould not being dead, be there left without company, and ſo euery yeare, many being put therein, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced finding no way out, to aſſociate him in his death. In this inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable wood, did <hi>Dedalus</hi> place <hi>Theſeus,</hi> where the Gréeke youth had loſt himſelfe, not knowing how, nor which way he had got in there. It gréeued him not, for his inuincible heart incouraged him to greater matters. The fourth day of his wandring through the wood, hee came vnto a faire walke, whoſe Couert of gréene Iuie, reaching from trée to trée on eyther ſide, was ſo thicke, that neither ſun nor ſtarre could pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate it at no time, and therefore it was naturally moſt colde, beſides that <hi>Dedalus</hi> with his ſkill had made it more, when there he left the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull <hi>Thenian,</hi> with fréezing colde to extinguiſh the burning heate, wherewith he loued <hi>Phedra,</hi> forſaking her ſiſter that had giuen him no leſſe then his life, helping him to the bottome of the thréed, by which he iſſued out of the Laborinth. So he indured excéeding torments, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on nothing, ſaue that none ſhuld paſſe that way, fearing that ſome one woulde vanquiſh the <hi>Minotaure,</hi> that kept ſomewhat more within.</p>
               <p>Scarce could the Gréeke Prince endure the coldneſſe of the Lane, and but that he iudged it baſe feare, he had returned backe: yet encouraging himſelfe, valiantly with his ſheeld, he paſſed on forwards, till he met with the mightie <hi>Theſeus,</hi> clad al in moſt rich greene armor, garniſhed of tawnie Lyons, beſet with many rich and vnualuable ſtones.</p>
               <p>A foote ſtood the fierce <hi>Athenian,</hi> leauing againſt a mightie ſtéele battle-axe, with a ſword girded at his ſide, looking with ſuch a ſterne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as <hi>Mars</hi> had feared him. But <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne borne to maiſter him, vndauntedly ſtept to him with ſuch courteſie, as he thought his perſon merited, ſaying. Moſt valiant knight, I would gladly finde a paſſage from a place ſo yrkeſome as this, and if along this Lane be the way, I intreate you ſuffer me fréely to paſſe. With admiration of his gallant diſpoſition, did <hi>Hercules</hi> companion thus reply. Moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faire <hi>Donzell,</hi> I would pleaſure you in this, or any thing elſe, but my ingratitude bringing me hither, forceth mee to let none paſſe this way, onely to haue more company (being alone) to aſſociate me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:79"/>And ſo may you ſéeke an other way, although I beléeue there is none but this. Why then (ſaid our new <hi>Mars</hi>) I ſhall be conſtrained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, and ſo reſt nothing beholding to you for it. Whereupon as if hée were better armed then the Athenian, well couering himſelfe with his ſhéeld, paced towards him, who became more fiercer, then when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the earthes blacke Center, ſéeing the boldneſſe of the youth ſo yoong and armorleſſe, preſuming to win what onely was committed to his ſtrength, in ſo many dangers and haughtie enterpriſes approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. He raiſed aloft his axe, thinking to haue cleft him in the middeſt. But the gallant youth leaping aſide, meant not onely to make him looſe his blowe, but to cloſe with him, hauing an eye vnto his ſword, hoping that if he had it, to aſſure his victorie therewith.</p>
               <p>At this time he miſt of his intent, for <hi>Theſeus</hi> was none of thoſe that admitted any ſuch brauados: but in the middeſt of the ſtroke, before his aduerſarie could enter, he ſtayed the axe, diſcharging ſuch a blowe on his ſhéeld, with the point, that he inforced him backe ſwifter then hee came, with greater paine on his breſt, for the ſhéeld ſtriking there, made him almoſt breathleſſe. He had not effected this blowe, when with the blade he offered an other. He flooriſhed it aboue his head ſo mightily, that had not the Gréeke fallen on his, he had bene cleane parted in two. He ſaw himſelfe within deathes clawes, for the very wind the weapon yéelded in his paſſage, was inough to ſtrike downe an other leſſe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anter then he. He would not then ketch at his ſword, becauſe the other ouerwharted him in it, but rather with the nimble ſkill his tutors had taught him, ſéemed to ſtay a blowe, lifting his ſhéeld on high, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian beléeuing that he would, and that therewith he ſhould terminate that controuerſie, well ſetled on his left leg, hee let fly at him a downe-right blowe. It is credible, that hitting him with the axe, he had diuided not him alone, but the ſtrongeſt Rocke. He that ſhould liberate the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Lady, would not ſo truſt to his ſhéeld: for as the axe deſcended, ſwifter then thought, he cloſed with him, thruſting himſelfe vnder his armes, and with his, he aſtoniſhed him with a blowe running his ſhéeld againſt his head, whereat the other for feare of giuing backe, reſiſted him with all his ſtrength, and ſo ayding his left leg outwards, our new warrior met with the ſwords handle, the which without more adoo, he eaſily drew forth, whoſe blade yéelded ſuch ſplendor as the Prince was amazed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:80"/>It was many years ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Athenian</hi> had not ſéen his naked ſword, which now viewing in his enemies power, there is no Lyon in fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe comparable to him. Néeds would the Gréeke youth trie his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered weapon before he got from him, diſcharging it with all his ſtrength on that ſide it hung. His armor it cut not, for the world had none better, but it ſo tormented his legge and thigh, that he could not ſtand thereon. So <hi>Claramant</hi> ſtepping from him, ſaide. Now ſhall thou know (knight) how much better it had béene for thée, to haue let me fréely paſſe, and kéepe thy weapons, then to bée without them, for they now ſhall make me way. Why then ſtay (ſaid hee) diſcourteous youth, and thou ſhalt ſée whether the hauing of my ſword can defend thée from <hi>Theſeus</hi> wrath, at whoſe preſence al <hi>Plutos</hi> kingdome trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And ſo he ſtrooke at him a moſt mightie blow. He could not ſo defend it, but it fell vpon one ſide of his ſhield, cutting it away: and made him thrice turne about. But ſuddainly he recouered, and firmed himſelfe againſt his aduerſarie, that with his axe poynt came againſt him. He turned away and ſcapt it, diſcharging his ſword vppon his helme. It ſounded like a bell, making a diſpleaſant muſicke chatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his téeth.</p>
               <p>Ere <hi>Theſeus</hi> could recouer himſelfe, he gaue him another, it was it which gaue him the victorie, by the paſſing with the poynt betwéene the cloſing of his armor. Cutting his priuie coate of male, the ſharpe blade entred vnto his fleſh: had he not feared the axe, and a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder thruſt his arme, he had ſlaine the <hi>Athenian:</hi> yet it was the firſt time that the ingratefull Louer ſawe his owne blood, whoſe ſight ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch furie to his furie, that now hee will not procéede like a ſkilfull knight, but let his blowes flie at randon, which put the youth in more daunger and aduiſed care to ſhunne them, aſſuring himſelfe, that blow which tooke him full, would be his death: and therefore he behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with ſuch dexteritie, as his couſin had hee béene there, could haue done no more.</p>
               <p>Oh it was a ſpectacle woorthie the Gréeke Theater, for the haughtie <hi>Athenian</hi> fiercer then when he ſlew the Tyrant <hi>Creon,</hi> procured to giue him but one blowe, the which with ſinguler agilitie the Gréeke ſhunned. There is no Roe in ſwiftneſſe like to him, for entring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring at his pleaſure, ſometimes hee wounded <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and euerie time he tooke him ful with his famous ſword, he made him tremble like
<pb facs="tcp:13978:80"/>
the toppe of a high proude pyne, ſhaken with the voyce of heauen. Hée himſelfe receiued ſome, but they were on his ſhield, the which in that daungerous battell ſaued his life. Sixe houres they haue fought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſt. They were in the end (ſwéet Miſtreſſe) made of fleſh &amp; blood, and muſt feele the exceſſiue paine and trouble, ſo at once without any word, they withdrew to breath: for although the Gréek was not woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet his much labour had ouer much wearied him. Againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe bitterly exclaimed the <hi>Athenian,</hi> ſéeing himſelfe both matcht and wounded, by one knight without armor. The Gréeke had no cauſe yet to complaine, for this was his firſt battell, yet he incouraged himſelfe to end it to his glorie. As he walked vp and downe, he paſt by an oake, whereon he read an inſcription to this effect.</p>
               <q>Diſmay not, oh thou valiant Knight, that by thy valour haſte arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to vngratefull <hi>Theſeus</hi> walke, but take courage, for vangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing him, and winning his armor, thou doeſt arriue (this being thy firſt battell) vnto the higheſt top of honour, reſeruing in thy power, the hopes of greateſt ioyes.</q>
               <p>Hauing read the letters, the Gréeke thought nothing what hée had before him, conſidering the promiſe redounding by the victorie. No longer would he reſt, for the deſired end of the aduenture will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee him more to breath: and ſo couering himſelfe with the remainder of his ſhield, and ſtrongly gryping his ſword in his hands, went againſt the <hi>Athenian,</hi> ſaying. Come knight, let vs end our battell, for it is a ſhame it ſhould ſo long laſt, being but betwéene two. <hi>Theſeus</hi> replied, taking his axe twixt both his hands. There is not any, but at his firſt ſemblance would haue trembled like an Aſpen leafe: yet the haughtie youth feareleſſe, confronted him. His axe flouriſht, the <hi>Athenian</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue hit him with the blade. But the gallant youth, whoſe ſtrength excelled his, with his ſwoord ſtrooke it away: within him hée ſtept, letting flie a mightie thruſt at his breaſt, whoſe force made him fenceleſſe giue backe, drawing his battell axe after him. <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne followed him hard, and ere he could raiſe it from the ground, hée layde on the viſor of his helme ſuch a blowe, that he thought the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had fallen, ſo many ſtarres he ſawe about his eares. So abaſhed to be ſo handled was <hi>Ariadnes</hi> reiecter, for euen as hee dragd his axe,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:81"/>
hee hoyſt it aloft, that the Gréeke could not eſcape the blowe, nor ſhun a wound vpon his right ſide, and yet but little, for féeling the blade, he yéelded to the left ſide, and let it paſſe, and ſéeing his wiſht occaſion, preſently cloſed with him. The <hi>Athenian</hi> durſt not let go the axe, for therein conſiſted his ſtrength: whereby vnable to helpe himſelfe as he would in this ſtrife, ſurely <hi>Claramant</hi> wonne ground of him. A bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wraſle could not almoſt be ſéene, for the Prince being vnarmed, and therefore nimbler, trippes, tangles, and vntangles his legges with more dexteritie: which his aduerſarie could not do, although by méere ſtrength he valiantly reſiſted. The Gréeke offering to take the axe from him, ſnatcht at it, but too ſtrong ſo eaſily to part from it, was the <hi>Athenians</hi> holde.</p>
               <p>Oh, who would not wiſh to ſée this braue contention, for ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Theſeus</hi> to defend it, fetches forces from his alreadie fainting mind, and the Gréeke to winne it, imployeth the vtmoſt of his valour. Thus contending, they were almoſt at the end of the Alley, when <hi>Trebati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os</hi> iſſue with a fine ſlight got the victorie. For ſéeming to let go the axe, looſened a little his hold, and himſelfe ſtepping ſomething backe. The <hi>Athenian</hi> did the like, thinking ſo to reaſſure his axe: but the Gréeke ſetling himſelfe ſtrongly on his legges, ſtept in, and on the ſuddaine wroong it out of his hands. No ſooner had he done it, but all that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred fréezing Alley, ſéemed on a light burning fire. The thundrings, lightnings, and hideous ſhoutes, not a little amazed the Prince, and him that was without, no leſſe, who not able to indure, imagining the haughtie Donzell to be in ſome daunger, entred through thoſe intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pathes. By the <hi>Athenians</hi> looſing of his axe, the paſſage was frée, ſo farre as the Donzell was. So he arriued when his inuincible Vncle gazed on the armor <hi>Theſeus</hi> had left him vpon a table of Iaſpar, wher there ſtood a Piller with an Epitaph. He then quieted himſelfe, ſéeing it was the knight that had diſinchanted him. They embraced with ſuch loue, as if they knew the conſanguinitie betwéene them. Now may you (ſir knight) ſaid <hi>Claramant,</hi> ſéeing fortune hath giuen me armour and weapons, let me receiue the order of them at your hands. In all things I deſire to ſatiſfie your content, faire Donzell (replied the diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prince) wiſhing it no leſſe then mine. But now reſt a while, for we ſhall haue time ynough to doo it, for I beléeue the winning of theſe armes, haue coſt you no ſmall trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:81"/>Some indéed it hath (ſaid <hi>Clarament</hi>) but beeing ſo well acquittanced with the enioying of your ſight, and theſe rich armes, I account it wel beſtowed. But let vs read this ſcrowle, for I feare we haue more to do to get from this accurſed place. So hand in hand they went to the Piller, and read the diſcription thus.</p>
               <q>When the two moſt fierceſt Lyons ſhall meete in the valley of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull <hi>Theſeus,</hi> the one winning his armor, and receiuing the order of knighthood of him that gaue him his liberty, and vangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the <hi>Minotaure,</hi> then ſhall the inchantments of ancient <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus</hi> haue end.</q>
               <p>It greatly reioyced <hi>Claridiano,</hi> to ſée that he might ſafely giue him the order of Chiualrie. And with one accord hee armed and knighted him at once. They fitted him ſo well, as if of purpoſe they had béene forged for him. Neuer had <hi>Archiſiloras</hi> Louer ſéene a gallanter knight: ſomewhat bigger he was then his couſin, but not taller: wherefore the wiſemen alwaies doubted whether was the valianter, for their particular battels one againſt the other, it could neuer be ſéene. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on foote with the battel-axe, no knight could abide the ſtrength of <hi>Claramant.</hi> Fewe times carried he ſhield, the better to play with his are, and therefore was he ſurnamed the <hi>Cruel,</hi> for with it hee ſpilled more blood then the fierce <hi>Affrican.</hi> With excéeding ioy did he gyrt his ſword, embracing him with excéeding ſignes of loue. They vowed ſuch great amitie, that their knowledge of vncle and couſin, could not more augment it. A while they reſted, that with more courage the new knight might prooue the aduenture of the <hi>Minotaure.</hi> So much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the late armed Prince, to ſée the beaſt, as he roſe, ſaying. It is time (ſir knight) to end this buſineſſe, for being ſo ſurely backt, were the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe more difficult, the victorie is moſt certaine.

But where they ſeem offenſiue, paſſe them ouer, though loue haue ordained them, and yet reſpecting the cauſe, I know you will not condemne the effect. For although now you ſée the Gréeke Prince buſied with cruell warres, too ſoone he will be ledde where he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, there is no good where the little blind God doth not raigne, and this euen when ayded with nothing but his ſtrength, hee ſhall ſet frée the faire Princeſſe of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> from her ſtrong inchauntment. But before that happens, attend, and you ſhall heare what him befell entring the blinde Laborinth.</p>
               <p>His axe he carrid afore, and with vnremoouing ſteppes, hee entred the way-confuſed habitation, where he ſo often turned and returned, comming backe when as he thought himſelfe to go forward, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch by-waies at euery ſecond pace, that when he iudged to be at the end, he found himſelfe at the doore. Sometime he heard, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great amazement, the noyſe of voyces crying: The rich armor thou haſte wonne bolde knight, ſhall not auaile thée to get from our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:82"/>
in recompence of thy preſumption to diſquiet vs: and then felt hée ſuch mightie blowes, that often made him ſet his hands and knées vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground: but conſidering how litle he had done by winning the armor, and how the other valiant knight expected him, ſo animated him to indure thoſe huge ſtrokes, which none but he could haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wearie and tired, he at laſt came where he ſawe a little light, that iſſued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a high cranny of the wal. It gladded him, for by it, he found a way that brought him vnto a faire large yard, about whoſe wals were many pictures and ſtories ſo naturally drawne, that they ſomewhat eaſed his paine.</p>
               <p>By them he vnderſtood <hi>Paſiphaes</hi> beaſtly acceſſe vnto the Bull. It ſo diſliked him, that he turned away his eyes, being offended, not with the pictures, but with what it repreſented. Hee ſawe <hi>Theſeus</hi> cladde in thoſe armes he won of him, enter the Laborinth, with the thread tied to his arme, and at the doore the two beautifull ſiſters, that with feare did ſtay for him. The cauſe was, they loued, and where that paſſion is, none can liue ſecure, fearing alſo the good it enioyeth. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, he ſawe how ill repayed <hi>Ariadne</hi> was, being left to the mercie of the windes among wilde beaſts. To ſuch pittie was he mooued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Ladie, that caſting vp his eyes to heauen, he ſaid. Oh cruell knight, vnwoorthie the name of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> imploying ſo ill thoſe partes the heauens hath adorned thee with, but eſpecially againſt a weake ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ladie, whom if reaſon had béen thy guide, thou ſhouldeſt haue hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, although thy life were hazarded. A new battell (were it poſſible) would I haue with thée vppon this, to make thée confeſſe thy crueltie and ingratitude.</p>
               <p>He vowed to himſelfe to helpe all Ladies, though hee indaungered his life: which he performed ſo well, that many vnder that name, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly durſt trauell alone, and euerie one called him the knight of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. His owne image ſawe hee a little further, and his battell fought with <hi>Theſeus,</hi> togither with thoſe which <hi>Claridiano</hi> made about his libertie. He reioyced to ſee the haughtie déeds of his new friend. Being about to go to the other ſide of the yard, to view thoſe pictures there, as he turned, he eſpied two knights all in armor comming towardes him, with their ſhields and ſwords readie for the fight. Their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſemblance and brauerie much pleaſed the Gréeke: beeing neare him, one ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:83"/>Thou haſte béene much ouerſéene (knight) not acknowledging Loues ſoueraigntie, to enter a place ſo prohibited, where be ſure thou ſhalt be called to ſtrickt accounts. They ſtayed for no anſwere, but ere he could ſway his axe about, they gaue him two mightie blowes, one on his ſhoulder, and the other on his helme. Both he greatly felt, eſpecially ſo cowardly to be aſſaulted. With an Eagles ſwiftnes he got fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwéen them, into the middeſt of the broad yard, the better to vſe his daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous axe. He ſtretcht it out at length, awaiting for his aduerſaries, that nothing fearing, followed him. With the poynt he hit one, almoſt beheading him, for with the blade he ſorely wounded his throate: hée drew backe his axe, and winding it about, layed on his ſhield, the which he ſtrooke to the ground, and his Maiſter headlong at his féete. His companion was not careleſſe, but comming behind, gaue him ſo ſtrong a blowe vppon his helme, that though he cut it not, yet hee bended it to his breaſt.</p>
               <p>Like a furious Lyon turned the Gréeke againſt him, whom hée found ſo neare, that to hit him, he was faine to draw back his armes, and with a fierce incounter he ranne his ſhield through, and wounded him on the breaſt, making him ſtagger backwards, and to helpe him downe, hee raiſed his axe, and diſcharging it on the ſide of his helme, he cut away all that part, with a great peece of his inchaunted gorget. He felled him at his féete, and was ſo eager to end with him, that hee forgot his other aduerſarie, who aſſayling him at his backe, gaue him ſo fierce a blowe vpon his middle, that his companion executing ano, ther in the ſame place, they had almoſt felled him. Neuer was Beare nor Tiger more fierce then now the Prince became againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, raiſing aloft his axe. He could not miſſe his blowe, for they were before him. So with all his ſtrength he hit one on the ſhoulders, the blowe was ſo mightie, that all the blade he hid within his breaſt, ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his heart in two.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he finiſhed this, when he laide vppon his other enemie, who was ſo ſkilful, that ere the axe deſcended, he got vnder his armes, running at his breaſt with a thruſt. This blow much gréeued the Gréeke, for it ſtopt the paſſage of his breath: and hee ſeemed to awaite the axe: but for all the haſte he made to ward the blowe, it firſt crowned him with death, for falling on his head, diuided in two, he ſent him to accompany his friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:83"/>The hideous noyſe which hee heard in the next roome, would let him take no reſt, but rather leaning on his axe, he ſtayed more warily to ſée what it was. When preſently with admiration he was amazed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feareful <hi>Minotaure</hi> ſo vgly and deformed. His face was like a mans, although farre bigger: his eyes glowed like a furnace of kindled fire. On his large front hee had two mightie hornes, whoſe poynts were harder then any Diamond: his necke ſhort and thicke. So big and broad a breaſt he had, that the very fight witneſſed his ſtrength. He was of a dunne colour, and went vpright as wel on his hinder legs, as on all foure. In ſtead of clouen féete, hee had moſt ſharpe clawes, with which there was no armor but he would rent. In bigneſſe he was but as an ordinarie Bull, yet ſwifter then an Ounce, and ſo with his ſtrength he aſſured his light incounters. With ſuch fierceneſſe hee came, that the Prince thought he ſhould want time to view him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, he fixed his foote ſtrongly on the paued yard, vntil approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to execute his blowe, hee gaue him way, letting him paſſe ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the winde.</p>
               <p>There wanted no ſpectacles to ouer-view the battel, for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ouer the yarde were full of beauteous Ladies, among whom, (had he but his right iudgement) he might haue ſéene the tamer of his heart: neither did their want gallant Knights to accompany them, for <hi>Dedalus</hi> had alſo prouided that, when he firſt made that inchantment in reuenge of <hi>Ariadnes</hi> wrong.</p>
               <p>The ſpéedie returne of the luſtful Quéenes ſonnes returne, put him from his gazing: but hee found the Prince ſo watchful, that his haſtie courſe was to no effect. Thrée carriers paſt they thus, neither woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other, yet ſo wel could not the Prince defend himſelfe, but at laſt the Bul met with him. He ſtrooke him not ful with both hornes, for ſo he had indaungered him, ſaue with one, hitting him on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which forced him to ſhewe more ſignes to be a tumbler, then a ſkilfull Knight. He was ſo abaſhed to be ſo vſed, that fiercer then any Tiger hee ſtayed his returne: which hee did with his accuſtomed lightneſſe. Him did the warlike Gréeke expect with his axe on high, till he approached ſo neare, that to his thinking he could not looſe his blow: with all his ſtrength he turned it, giuing the furious <hi>Minotaure</hi> ſuch a blowe betwéene his hornes, that he made him giue backe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:84"/>He thruſt the blade ſo much forth, that the blow was but with the ſtaffe, which ſounded as if it had fallen on a plate of ſtéele. With his pawes the beaſt catched at the Prince, who with a leape eſcaped him, ſwaying about his dangerous weapon, diſcharged it on his fore knée, whoſe hard hyde could not ſaue it from cutting cleane off. Neuer on the earth was heard more fearefull bellowing then the Bull made, wounded ſo dangerouſly. Somewhat careleſſe ſtood the youth, thinking on the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous blowe he had made, that he was forced to receiue one nothing inferior to his: for the beaſt ſuddenly ran at him with both his hornes. To the fine temper of his breſtplate, is <hi>Claramants</hi> life imputed: for had it bene otherwiſe, from ſide to ſide hee had pierced him: but finding a ſtay, ſo fiercely to reſiſt him, he was ſtrooke with a ſore fall on the paued ground. There, hauing his other foote to helpe him with, he had ſurely ſlaine him. Neuertheleſſe, with his right pawe (which was that was left) he tooke hold of his ſhoulder, and wroong him ſo hard, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince thought that part, to be cruſhed to péeces. He drew it to himſelfe, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away all it catcht in his enchaunted clawes, which was his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</p>
               <p>So ſtrongly he hoyſed the Gréeke, that he ſet him on his féete. Some feare conceiued the haughtie youth, at the beaſtly creatures fierceneſſe. He was not able to vſe his axe, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Minotaure</hi> holding down his head, tooke him betwéen his hornes, and floong him excéeding high into the emptie ayre: falling ſo miſerably on the ſtones vpon his left arme, that he thought it and his body all bruſed. Here <hi>Galtenor</hi> dares not vndertake certainly to expreſſe the rage that poſſeſſed the Gréeke Prince. The hardeſt Dyamond would he haue cleft: ſo fierce he turned vpon <hi>Paſiphaes</hi> ſonne, that like lightning came againſt him, againe to hoyſt him on his hornes: but before he approached to execute his furious encounter, <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne diſcharged ſuch a blowe on one of his hornes, that it and part of his head came to the ground, and from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Who clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Gréeke, caſting his clawes vpon his ſword hills, the which he drew forth, laying ſuch a blowe vpon his helme, that with hands and knées he kiſſed the earth. He feared not ſo much his combat againſt <hi>Theſeus,</hi> being without armour, then now ſéeing his weapon in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:84"/>Increaſed ſo was his feare, hearing a clamourous noyſe that ſaide. Dead art thou diſtreſſed Prince, for neuer ſhalt thou ſée thy deſired Parents, nor thy new friend that expects thée. It was no time to make reply to thoſe words, nor ſéeke for them that ſpake them: for the diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh beaſt fenſt with the ſword ſo brauely and quicke, that he conſtrained the Gréeke to vſe all his poſſible care to ſhun his blowes by his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And the Bulles bleeding, was to his no ſmall auaile, for with his turning it fell on his eyes, that it much blinded his ſight. So wel could not <hi>Alphebos</hi> brother ſaue himſelfe, but he was ouertane with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blowe, ſidelong it lighted on his necke péece, cutting moſt part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and had the ſtroke bene giuen aduiſedly, his necke from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he had ſundred. The beaſt euer ſo cloſed with the Prince, that he could not fetch about with his axe, that taking it by the toppe, he could no more but ſtrike him with the point, yet all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blade with the ſtrength of his armes he hid within his breſt, and thruſt him away all the length of his axe, that he could not hit him with his ſword, being out of his reach.</p>
               <p>There is no poyſonous Baſſeliſke to be compared with the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man-halfe-Bull: who caſting flouds of blood from his eye and breſt, proſecuted his diſordered battle ſo cruelly, that the vexed Gréek breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and tyred with ouermuch labor, knewe not which way to turne himſelfe. And for all he ſawe the Monſter deadly wounded, yet he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted the victorie, becauſe he neuer reached him with the ſharpe ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſword, but it made him ſet his knées to the earth. All the yard was dyed with beaſtly bloodie gore, and ſuch abundance therof he had ſhed, that he ſéemed nothing ſo fierce as in the beginning. Well did <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> perceiue it, which infuſed new hopes in his fainting minde. A thouſand times called he himſelf coward, ſéeing that battle ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, which he iudged his friend would haue had long afore ended, if he were in his place.</p>
               <p>Moſt circumſpectly, and with the greateſt care he could, he away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and it was not in vaine towards the ending of the cruell fight: for the fierce beaſt returning with his full carreir, he ſtrooke him on the head: in two he cleft it, and felde him dead at his féete. He was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner downe, but all that edefice was couered ouer with thicke blacke fogge.</p>
               <p>Shrikes and howlings were heard, vgly illuſions and fantaſmos,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:85"/>
appeared to the Prince, that had he not bene <hi>Claramant,</hi> there he had for euer left his life. The horror which the Caſtle and all the Inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in the vaniſhing, ſtrooke him in a traunce on the ground, and was no leſſe, then if heauen and earth ſhould haue met with fierce incounters.</p>
               <p>An houre and more laſted the tempeſtuous noyſe, in the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſkies cleared, and <hi>Claramant</hi> found himſelf neare to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the thrée Pipes, from whence <hi>Claridiano</hi> ranne to imbrace him, and ioyfull to ſée him ſafe, ſaid taking off his Helme. How doo you féele your ſelfe (moſt valiant Knight?) for I am ſure, conſidering the outragious cries I heard, you haue not bene idle. I haue vndergone all things eaſily (ſir Knight) replied his vncle, only by hoping of your ſight, which hath leſſened all my troubles if any be ſuſtained. So ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe at the Fountaine, he related to him all his ſucceſſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at his couſin remained no leſſe amazed then content, iudging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight to be the ſonne of vallour, of whome <hi>Claridiano</hi> intreated he might know who he was.</p>
               <p>Were it for nothing elſe (Sir Knight replied <hi>Claramant</hi>) but to ſatiſfie your content, I ſhould haue thought my ſelfe moſt happie, if Fortune would haue let me tell you who I am: But hauing ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me with your deare ſight and acquaintance, no maruel if this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo ſauour of ſome diſcontent, as in not being able to reueale my parentage to you, becauſe indéed I knowe not who I am, more then that I haue ſome yeares bene nouriſhed in this Groue, being made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding much of, yet not knowing by whom, nor for what cauſe, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
               <p>Sometimes to comfort me in my ſolitarineſſe, they told me I was of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of Noble parents. There is no ioy comparable to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridianos,</hi> hearing he was a Gréeke, perſwading himſelfe certainly he was his kinſman. Againe he imbraced him, gratulating his being of that Countrey, and his Countrey man. <hi>Claramant</hi> requeſted alſo to know him, ſince the friendſhip vowed betwéene them, might allow no ſecret from the other. To pleaſe him, <hi>Claridiano</hi> did it. The kiſſing of his hands intreated his faire vncle, ſaying. The not knowing you (ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince) hath made me commit ſo manifeſt an error: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſigne of inpenetrated pardon, graunt me your victorious hands, that I may thereon expiate the offering of my innocency on them, due
<pb facs="tcp:13978:85"/>
to your worthineſſe. His tender Couſin imbraced him and ſaid. Moſt valiant Knight, this is not tollerable, yours being of ſuch deſerts, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting the dutie of all the world: And truſt me, you are too blame to vſe me with ſuch ceremonies, that am your profeſſed friend, and wil be til the death. All that day they reſted there, in pleaſant conuerſation paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away the time, where <hi>Paliſandro</hi> reioyced in his very ſoule, that his Lord had found ſo mightie a friend.</p>
               <p>So many things did the Prince diſcourſe to him of <hi>Grecia,</hi> which ſo contented <hi>Claramant,</hi> that he intreated him to returne and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him thither: The which <hi>Archiſiloras</hi> Louer graunted, purpoſing to diſcouer himſelfe to none, arriued in <hi>Crecia,</hi> and ſo he praied his vncle.</p>
               <p>In the afternoone, the two Heroicke warriors tooke their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea. At their departure from the Fountaine, on the Piller that contained the former words, they reade theſe.</p>
               <q>The intricate Laborinth and vanquiſhment of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> the moſt ingratefulleſt of all Louers, was ended by the mightie Kinght of the <hi>Lyons,</hi> in preſence of his greateſt friend and kinſman: by whom he firſt receiued his libertie. And ſo both ended the famouſeſt aduenture in the world.</q>
               <p>The ſuſpitious words to be neare Allies, could not more augment the Louers amitie betwéene the two haughtie youthes, although they increaſed new ioy, hoping in the end that Prophecie would iſſue true. Thus they arriued at the ſea ſhore, where they founde their inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Barke richly prouided with all neceſſaries for the Gréeke Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Who being ſhipt therein, with more fury then doth a Commet croſſe the azure ſkies, it launched into the déepe. Where of force we muſt leaue them, returning to <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XX. How <hi>Lyſarte</hi> King of <hi>Tharſis,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Floriſarte,</hi> Prince of <hi>Argentaria,</hi> arriued with their Fleete within ſight of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous Tower,</hi> and what elſe happened.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I am conſtrained altogither vnwillingly to leaue treating of Loue and Loues diſcourſes, yet wil I not leaue to implore your fauours (bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Ladies) to march vnder the diſplayed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of ſterne and bloodie <hi>Mars.</hi> For if it he wel conſidered, this is an amorous warre, procéeding of affection, wherein the chéefeſt and valianteſt thereof, imparts no blowe vpon their enemies, but is guided by <hi>Cupid.</hi> Some fight here to pleaſe their Ladies, others, to giue her libertie incloſed in the Tower, whoſe loue many proſecuted, but only by one is obtained. And others to become Louers, chooſe this warre as their beſt meanes for it, which indéed ſorted not in vaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many ſacrificed their liberties to vnknowne Ladies, eſpecially in <hi>Greece,</hi> where the blinde God kept the greateſt part of his treaſure, wherewith he captiuates the ſtrongeſt hearts. So that (diuine Ladies) while I follow <hi>Mars</hi> his Drumme, I doo not forget the footing of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> daunces. And this opinion is wel confirmed by the gallant <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarte,</hi> Prince of <hi>Argentaria,</hi> who neither Armes, nor the being among ſo many bloods, could extinguiſh the remembrance of his Loue, not knowing who it was, ſaue only to maintaine his word, ingaged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed <hi>Artinio,</hi> that for <hi>Arbolindas</hi> ſake, the faire Princeſſe of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had ſo laide that plot, heretofore recited: whoſe memorie and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, made him within his Helme drowne his eyes in teares. It is common (excellent Ladies) among amourous Gallants, alwaies to bewaile their greateſt euil, although many other preſent daungers doo incompaſſe them.</p>
               <p>In this perplexitie the valiant youth in his fathers company, with all his Fléete nauigated the Gréeke ſea with proſperous winde. With ſuch great deſire came the Argentarians, and men of <hi>Tharſis</hi> to fight, that they thought they ſhould neuer ſée the occaſion to ſhew their kings
<pb facs="tcp:13978:86"/>
how greatly they deſired to haue them. Ten dayes they ſayled on the Vaſt ſeas, méeting with nothing that might hinder their voyage, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Gréeke armes in middeſt of their Cullours. The eleuenth day early in the morne, they diſcryed a mightie. Nauie of ſhips and Gallies, houering vp and downe, vpon the calme waters. They were aboue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hundreth ſayles. So not knowing what they were, nor of whoſe part, they ſtrook alarm, ſéeing the great aduantage they had ouer them, both in winde, and lightneſſe of veſſelles. The Fléete of the Tharſian Prince, in good order began to caſt about in manner of a halfe Moone, diſcharging two péeces of ordinance, in ſigne of battle, ſetting forwards againſt their aduerſaries. Who as it ſéemed truſting to their ſtrength of multitudes, made ready their well furniſhed ſhips, and anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in like manner, aduancing on their Admirall, their royall armes: and thus they approached one an other, ſéeming to couer the ſeas. Foure of the <hi>Agentarian</hi> Gallies rowed forth without, ſpread ſayles to diſcouer their aduerſaries enſignes, which to their content they diſcried: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſight of them, they ſaw the imperiall Eagle, with two crowned heads, the ſelfeſame they had. In ſigne of peace and meſſage, the <hi>Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> hung out a white flagge. So they were ſuffered to paſſe among their ſhips, whoſe numbers of men and fierce Gyants amazed them. They boorded the Admirall, from whence two ancient Knights of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentaria,</hi> were in a Barge, conducted to the royall <hi>Galleon,</hi> where they deliuered their embaſſage vnto a mightie knight, that little wanted of a Gyants heigth, telling him how in their fléete were the kings of <hi>Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and <hi>Argentaria,</hi> from whom hauing ſéene their armes, they came to know whether they were on the part of <hi>Grecia,</hi> vnder whoſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard they alſo fought. Theſe newes excéedingly gladded the gallant youth, being no leſſe then valiant <hi>Abſtruſio:</hi> who would néeds expreſſe his thankfulneſſe for what <hi>Roſabell</hi> had done for him, hauing through his valour and ſtrength obtained his faire <hi>Syrinda:</hi> who knowing that her <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> went to <hi>Grecia,</hi> would not ſtay without him, dreading the want of his preſence. And ſo to conduct her with more ſafetie, hee had muſtered togither from both kingdomes and all the Ilands he had conquered by his valour, 300. thouſand Combattants, the ſkilfulleſt in Nauigation in all the wide world beſides, and he himſelfe excelling all others therein, becauſe with aduantage to giue a battell on the ſeas, hée ſeemed to haue bene onely borne thereto: hee brought with him 500.
<pb facs="tcp:13978:87"/>
puiſſant giants his friends, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to pleaſe him with many of their knights, accompanied him in that voyage. And in his ſhip to guard his deare la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, were twentie, proportioned like to pleſſe pynes. Now ſéeing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, he had reputed to be againſt him, came on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ehalfe of his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Prince, he declared who he was, and how he reioyced to haue met ſuch friends vnto the Gréekes and <hi>Roſabell.</hi> Preſently they ſounded in ſigne of peace, yet many of <hi>Abſtruſios</hi> followers, and Argentarians, gréeued thereat, becauſe they firſt deſired to haue made tryall of theyr perſons: but long was it not after, that they had occaſion to do it. By this was it knowne to <hi>Lyſart,</hi> who his reputed enemie was, and ſo to ſhew him extraordinarie courteſie, he and his ſonne with fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of the Galleon: and moſt kindly the two luſtie warriers embraced one an other. And ſo being knowne how they were all voyagers for one enterpriſe, and eyther relating how much they were bound to <hi>Roſabell,</hi> the mightie <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> burſt forth into theſe words. Oh <hi>Ioue,</hi> now I am fully aſſured, how effectually thou doſt impart thy fauours to the Gréekes: and I nothing wonder at the lamentable deſolation of ruined <hi>Troy,</hi> ſince al the good aduentures of the world are ſoly reſerued for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as due to their worths. And your Maieſtie hath reaſon mightie king of <hi>Tharſis,</hi> to ſhewe the office of a friend vnto ſo braue a Prince, and as for me, were I not he I am, ſhuld I denie what I owe, ſince through him I enioy my life, poſſeſſe my kingdome, and that which is more, and I moſt eſtéeme, is the happie fruition of my deare wife. And then he told him all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hapned with him, to <hi>Roſabels</hi> immortall glory. So <hi>Lyſarte</hi> requited his diſcourſe with an other of his Loues, and that therefore hee brought that Nauy to ayde them. It is no more then due (ſaid <hi>Abſtruſio</hi>) to helpe him that helpes ſo many to obtaine their ioyes, in whoſe purſute let vs ſpend our liues, to make him happie in content. And ſo ioyning both fléetes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither by the Tharſians direction, they ſet forwards, for <hi>Lyſarte</hi> was beſt acquainted with thoſe ſeas, and knew where the enchauntment ſtood, hauing bene at it when he freed <hi>Roſabell</hi> from it. Who deſirous
<pb facs="tcp:13978:87"/>
to honor the Pagan with more then ordinarie courteſie, commanded to be proclaimed throughout his Fléete, that euery one ſhould obey the mightie <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> as their Captaine Generall. Who taking ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereat, ſaid. Since our amitie muſt be of ſuch force and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I wold not (mightie Prince) you wold vſe theſe ceremonies with me. I do, but what I know you deſerue and is your due. Braue Prince (replyed <hi>Lyſarte</hi>) and therefore do but commaund, and we will all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: for now and at all times, we entend to be your ſouldiers, and ſo hée intreated him to paſſe into his Galley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not able to obtaine it, hee and his ſonne were faine to ſtay in that Galleon. With the noiſe of many inſtruments, the two puiſſant Nauies began to ſhape their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nyquea.</hi> They had ſuch faire weather and proſperous winde, that on the fourth day of their Nauigation, they diſcried the flames of fire that iſſued from the Tower. Thither they turned their courſe, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth ſixe ſwift ſayling Gallies, to diſcouer their way. The which were ſo neare the Tower, that they ſawe a moſt daungerous battell fought betwéene the Arches. The reaſon was, for that the mightie <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorant</hi> making his abode there, would ſuffer none to prooue the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp.</p>
               <p>Some about it had loſt their liues, and many their honors. They ſo long tarried, that from the South they diſcried before they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſuch an infinit number of ſayles, that it amazed their iudgements, déeming them to be aboue 4000. veſſelles of Ships, Barkes and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Neuer did <hi>Xerſes</hi> ſée at once ſo many ſayles togither. This fléete was the mightie Soldans of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> with whom all his friends bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned, came thitherward couering all the ſea of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Admirall, was the two Soldanes of <hi>Nyquea</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> being a brother of his whom <hi>Roſabell</hi> ſlew. Who ſéeing himſelfe ſo mightie, reſolued with all his ſtrength to reuenge his brothers death, and his was the greateſt part of that power. With them ioyned the Prince of <hi>Syconia, Venus</hi> Louer, the Sophy, the mightie King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria,</hi> with the Phenician: who hoping there to ſée their ſonnes, as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percio</hi> tolde them, agreed to ayde the Souldan of <hi>Nyquea.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:88"/>Enuious <hi>Luperſio</hi> ſo well pleaded for this braue knight, that he cauſed him to be created Lord Generall both by ſea and land, hee accepted the honor, iudging his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to be ſufficient to diſcharge a greater charge. He named for his Lieftenant and Subſtitute by ſea, the diſcreet king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> becauſe he had rather fight by Land, that he might order and diſpoſe of the Shippes and gallies, leaſt their numbers breaking into diſorder, might hazard their victorie, which otherwiſe they had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Euery one highly eſtéemed him, ſéeing his gallant behauiour, and knowing how he was honoured throughout the world. So many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſands of men they brought, that he thought he was able with them to ſubdue all the world: For moſt of the Princes were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with furious Giants, and many Sagitaries: eſpecially the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe his country affoorded moſt. With ſuch noyſe they arriued at the Tower, as if heauen and earth had met. Yet for all this, did not the two Combattants deſiſt from the cruell ſight, vntill the ſtrange knight ſaw how great a Fléete made thitherward, and then thinking it no wit, longer to ſtay, with a cruel point thruſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſturdie <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorant</hi> from him, and turning his barke, put foorth into the ſea, leauing the inraged Pagan ſo furious, that hee was about to follow him. Hée was nothing daunted with the ſight of ſo huge a Nauie, but rather wiſhed they would aſſault him, that hee might execute on them the wrath that the knight had put him in, who was none other, but the bewtious <hi>Archyſilora,</hi> who ſéeing the flames, came to the Tower. Within ſight ſhe ſtood, and ſo did the ſixe Gallies, to ſée what order they tooke. With ſoueraigne prayſes did <hi>Luperſio</hi> extoll the merits of the Knight of the Tower, ſo euery one called him. They all reioyced know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whoſe ſonne he was, and how he would take their part. He aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed his friend <hi>Bembo,</hi> to honour him: for in him conſiſted the ſure hopes of that doubtfull victorie.</p>
               <p>The Prince did ſo, ſending a Galley to ſalute him in his name. A little did not the Pagan eſtéeme the account that was made of him, &amp; much honoured <hi>Bembo,</hi> being acquainted with him. By <hi>Lupercios</hi> counſell the thrée moſt mightie Pagans, <hi>Bembo, Brauorant,</hi> and <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> his competitor, placed themſelues before the Arches, for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:88"/>There was neuer a Prince in all the Fléet, but went to know him, all whom he receiued with ſingular courteſie. But how he tendred <hi>Flora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liza,</hi> requires a new ſtorie: hers was the third voyce in counſel of war, for that dignitie had <hi>Lupercio</hi> procured her, by whoſe direction all the armie was gouerned. Neuertheleſſe, greatly ſorrowed the Soldane of <hi>Nyquea</hi> for his ſonnes abſence, thinking his preſence would haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his hopes.</p>
               <p>Scarce had that mightie Nauie caſt about the Tower, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no leſſe puiſſant then it, appeared Eaſtward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coaſt of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> the which but ſtripping the windes, purpoſed to get the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his enemies. It was the Emperour <hi>Trebatios,</hi> that with fiue hundreth ſhippes and galleyes made towards the highſt part of the Tower: ſomewhat a farre off, and from the toppes of their maſts they could deſcrie the Fléete at the Tower, which they iudged to be their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Neuer did <hi>Neptune</hi> on the ſeas behold a thing more ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, for both armies ſeemed two populous Citties. In the royall Admiral, all the Princes were met to conſult on the giuing of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
               <p>The Emperor brought with him the beſt men in all his Empire, and in his guard his ſonne <hi>Roſicler,</hi> the warlike <hi>Roſamond,</hi> with famous <hi>Brandafidel,</hi> and the ſtout <hi>Bramidoro</hi> king of <hi>Cerdena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For the Ladie perſwading her ſelfe that in ſo renowmed an enterpriſe, her beloued <hi>Dacian</hi> would ſurely be, would not ſtay in <hi>Grecia;</hi> but rather clad in her rich armour, was one that wonne moſt honour both on ſea and land. With him alſo came the ſonnes of the mightie <hi>Croanto,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Carmenian</hi> Iles, knights, whoſe like the world contained fewe. No leſſe guarded was the Emperor <hi>Alphebos</hi> Admiral, within which there was beſides himſelfe, his deare Empreſſe <hi>Teffereo,</hi> and the two valiant Spaniſh brothers: for his more ſafetie, he had with him twelue Gyants his neighbours, then who in all the aduerſe armie, there was none valianter, nor that with more truſt and care defended their Prince.

               <p>Come is the time (moſt valiant knights) wherein déeds will be more requiſet then words, hauing ſuch multitudes of ſtrong enemies to cope withall: &amp; if I be mooued to ſpeake thus, beléeue me, it is but to renew the memorie of the royall blood from whence we deſcend, &amp; the glory y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> our predeceſſors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age haue maintained, eternizing their fames therby, to all poſterities: intreating you as friends, that none would fight otherwiſe, then to make their enemies confeſſe the worth of their perſons, &amp; not for deſire of ſpoyle or gaine, and to expreſſe his duty, loue &amp; fidelitie towards his God, Prince and country: for this, &amp; nothing but this, will aſſure his victorie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the time, béeing incompaſſed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, that I dare not (faire diuine Ladie) paſſe one foote further without your ſpeciall fauor. Blacke and fatall was the day to many, taſting in it the ſower cup of death. But to thoſe whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was bent to pleaſe, reſeruing their liues to ſée the diſmall bloodie loſſe of others, ſome comfort was it to them, the hearing of ſo many drummes and trumpets eccho in the ayre, reſounding in the déepe, reioycing a ſo many diſplayed flagges and bannerets as daunced with the winds, the waighing of anchors, and hoyſting vp of ſayles, the noyſe which the poore ſlaues haue on the waters, beating them with their oares: the clamorous cries of euery Captaine, incouraging thoſe whom feare had alreadie daunted: the gliſtring ſhine of armour, and the confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding numbers of braue Knights and fierce Gyants, that on the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of euerie veſſell did expect their enemies: theſe and ſuch like ſights, amazed and admired the beholders. <hi>Neptune</hi> would not this day ſhew himſelfe cruell, nor <hi>Eolus</hi> let foorth more then one gentle breath, that did with ſwelling pride blowe big the Pagans ſayles. Who taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the good occaſion, with redoubled courage offered to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, accounting the conqueſt theirs.</p>
               <p>Oh who is he, able to deſcribe the manner of ſo many deaths that there were giuen? So great was the ſmoke iſſuing from their ſhottes, that they neither heard nor ſawe one another, which being paſt, and the welking clearing ouer head. Oh <hi>Mercury,</hi> would thou wert in middeſt of this battell, in apt eloquence to modell foorth the merits of euery particular woorth. But firſt the hideous cries of ſlaughtered bodies, the noyſe of warriours, the ſhrikes of the wounded, could not but be a cruell ſpectacle: for they were all betwéene two of the cruelleſt oppreſſed elements that were, fire and water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:90"/>Quickly fomed the ſeas with bloodie froth, and on it floated the dead carkaſſes of ſometime liuing creatures. Excéeding great was the ſlaughter that the Chriſtians made, with wilde fire and balles of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pitch and rozen. And as they vſed all poſſible celeritie in caſting it, and the winde that played with their running wings a little ſtrong, by that meanes was the deſtruction, which they made infinit: for neither ſtriking of ſayles, remoouing cabbins, and caſting ouerboord all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie tackle, auayled to auoyde the mercileſſe deuouring fire, which left neither maſt nor ſayle vnconſumed. Oh cruell Soldan of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> that doeſt delight to ſée the thing that would haue moued <hi>Nero</hi> to ſome pittie.</p>
               <p>Straunge waies for deathes were there ſéene, for ſome flying the fire, periſhed in the waters: nor is there a friend, that will helpe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The father in ſuch hurlebourly knowes not his deare ſonne, nor he remembers his ſire to pay him the debt he owes him, for life and nurture. Only euery one procures to liue, and when he cannot ſcape, to die, not to depart vnreuenged. This ſatiſfaction was the ſole comfort to them, that with cruell wounds flung at their enemies, and ſtumbling on their owne guttes, embraced a willing death, togither with their aduerſaries. Some ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging by their ſtrong hands ouerboord, ſawe the cruell axe deſcend, and cut them from his holde, and he reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſuch a death, rather then to be hewen in péeces by an Infidel. Others embraced like good friends, ſought their endes in the loweſt déepes, glad to kill, being killed. The proper life is heere had but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall eſtimation with his aduerſaries death. Others that to themſelues complained towards the heauens, againſt Fortune and their happes, ſawe their friends come ſtumbling without armes and legges vppon them.</p>
               <p>Such was the confuſion among them, that no order could be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although therin the Greek got ſome aduantage, becauſe their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were lighter and better prouided. The gallant Spaniſh Captaine with aduiſe of his Lieftenant generall, Countie of <hi>Medyna,</hi> appointed ſome ſmall boates well furniſhed, who with all neceſſarie diligence, cloſely pearced through tenne of the Pagans greateſt ſhips, the which with ſuch furie leaked, that on the ſuddaine, not knowing which way they were ſuncke, with an infinit number of men, chéefely Gyants, whoſe waights did ſooneſt ouerwhelme them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:91"/>Then preuailed not outcries of Pilots, nor the haſtie calling for boats, becauſe the Rowers fearing the fires which the Spaniards hurled, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtriued to ſaue themſelues, then their friends, whom they ſawe ſmothered in thoſe vnquenchable flames, and beeing vp to the chin in water, yet ſéemed to burne aliue. Peace, they iudged the two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie elements had made, ſéeing the aboundance of water could not frée them from the fire, nor the fire for feare of it, kéepe the waters from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelming them. From ſide to ſide ſome were thruſt, and theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed not for beeing wounded, but for want of company to comfort them, in their funerall obſequies. Well do the Gréekes defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, offending on this ſide, where the Spaniards brauely cried S. <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although they were confronted thrée to one, they gallantly ſtucke to it, ſeeing how victoriouſly the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> had aſſayled their enemies. Wonders performed the <hi>Troyan</hi> with his beloued <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> againſt the Pagan: but what auuales it, when for one they kil, there came twentie in his place, and ſo on either ſide the battell was at one ſtay: whoſe fiercenes may be forgot, remembring what on the right wing was done, where the fierce <hi>Alphebo</hi> which <hi>Claridiana</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, for no deuiſe can there be diſtinguiſhed, being all died in one ſanguine hiew. There all other meanes they did forget of fight, ſaue with their armes, that being come to handie blowes, who would not, but with more then admiration admire, ſéeing them boord the Shippe, wherein the two Soldans of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Nyquea</hi> were, walled about with ſo many furious Gyants. On his right hand went his Empreſſe <hi>Claridiana,</hi> like lightning among them. But the gallant <hi>Teffereo,</hi> expreſſing there who hee was, ſhewed by good experience the high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of his perſon. I beſéech your Maieſtie to follow me, for in deſpight of our foes, I will enter this ſhip (ſaid he.) Do ſo, for we will all back you (replied the two Louers) that no leſſe wiſht it then he. So the Ladie deſirous to be firſt, couragiouſly leapt into the aduerſe veſſel, and maugre all the Gyants that defended it, ſhe ruſht in among them: but it had like to haue coſt her life, for the Gyants iudging her to be of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, two of them gaue her two ſuch blowes at once, that careleſſe they ſtrooke her at their féete.</p>
               <p>Outright had they ſlaine her, or at leaſt taken her priſoner, if her
<pb facs="tcp:13978:91"/>
inuincible huſband with his vtmoſt ſpéed had not followed her cloſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt falling downe, with ſuch ſtrength he leapt among them. Many blowes he ſuffered, making no reckning of them, becauſe he onely ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at them that ſtrooke his Empreſſe. It is no new matter what hée now doth, diuiding the two Gyants at two blowes in foure parts, that had offended him, offending his Ladie.</p>
               <p>He durſt not go from her till ſhe recouered her ſelfe, becomming fiercer then a mountaine Lyoneſſe. Many liues dearely bought her wrath. Brauely were they backt by <hi>Teffereo,</hi> and the two Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards following them, togither with moſt of the Imperiall guard, and the foure Gyants, all which kept ſtill togither in a round, backe to backe.</p>
               <p>There was ſo many in the Soldans ſhippe to kéepe them at worke, that they had no time to looke about: for the Barkes and Galleyes of ſupplie, which <hi>Bembo</hi> as a ſkilfull Generall had appoynted for their purpoſe, ſerued to no other end but to fetch away wounded men, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing freſh ſouldiers for them, and of the beſt. Heere were one of the fierceſt conflicts that happened all that day: for the Tribizonians imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the valour of their Princes, would not haue them looſe what they had wonne.</p>
               <p>And therefore although thouſands periſhed, they brauely hindered their aduerſaries from ſuccour, which was no helpe for the Lords within. In her inchaunted Barke, had the braue Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi> ranged about all the battell, to finde out her friend <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde,</hi> whom ſhée greatly affected: but not méeting with her, her good fortune, or theirs that were in the ſhippe, conducted her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Séeing that cruell fight, and thinking them to bee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Trebatios</hi> his Sonnes, ſhee brauely leapt into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Barke, crying: <hi>Grecia</hi> and <hi>Lyra.</hi> Many knew her by the voyce, among whom were the Emperours that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt a number of Gyants.</p>
               <p>More deſtruction make not the vnſeaſonable ſhowers of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning waters, beating downe the ripened corne: nor with more furie flies not the haſtie fired powder, then the warlike <hi>Matrone</hi> with her ſword, ſhewes her ſelfe ioyning with the Gréeke. <hi>Mars</hi> wounding
<pb facs="tcp:13978:92"/>
the firſt Gyant ſhe met ſo brauely on the helme, that cleauing it, ſhee alſo cleft his head downe to the necke. With ſuch helpe (ſoueraigne Quéene ſaid <hi>Alpheo</hi>) our victorie will not bee ſo great, if this ſhippe ſhould of it ſelfe yéeld, although the greateſt perſonages of all the fléete be in it.</p>
               <p>It was no time to bée ſpent in anſwering courteſies, for the Gyants bée many and ſtrong, and die willingly in defence of their ſhippe, that by this was at the laſt to be conquered: for with the Quéens helpe, and the <hi>Trebezonians</hi> diligence, the two Soldans were conſtrained, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to fall in the hands of ſuch fierce warriours, to leape into a Pinnace, in whoſe ſuccors many others came, among which, was the <hi>Galeon</hi> wherein he came from <hi>Nyquea,</hi> into which they went, grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the loſſe of the other, which was one of the beſt in all the Fléet. Whereof neuer a man ſuruide, but euery one periſhed by the ſword, and they that fled that death, leaping into the ſea, ſwallowed it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eternall ſléepe.</p>
               <p>This victorie was not ſo clearely wonne, but they loſt tenne gallies of <hi>Trebizound,</hi> which the Pagans ſuncke, who alſo kept them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſome of theirs. Leauing the conquered veſſel well manned, and diſplaying on the toppe thereof the armes of <hi>Greece,</hi> victoriouſly they returned into their owne, and with all ſpéed the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Pilot to hale towards the Tower, where there was moſt to do, for the two braue Competitors being there, would ſuffer none to come thither without loſſe of life.</p>
               <p>Wée haue no reaſon thus long to forget the mightie <hi>Bembo,</hi> Lord generall of the Pagan armie, who eſpying the Gréeke Admirall, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that moſt of her Princes were in her, made with his againſt it. The noyſe of the vehement ſhocke was ſuch, that it ſéemed no leſſe then the incounter of two huge rockes. The Gréekes got the beſt, by reaſon ſhe bore her beake higher, wherewith ſhe bruſed all that ſide. Here do they fight as if they were on maine land, for Galley to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and ſhip to ſhippe, beeing grappled togither, the arme muſt onely procure the victorie.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Bembo,</hi> who would not wiſh to ſée the buſied in the things thou didſt neuer exerciſe? For firmly fixing thy féete on the ſhips ſide, &amp; with thy ſword twixt both ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, executed blowes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Mars</hi> wold haue thoght
<pb facs="tcp:13978:92"/>
impoſſible, but as in the other, there were ſuch knights, his déeds did nothing amaze them, neither <hi>Don Celindos,</hi> nor his braue ſiſters, who were confronted with the haughtie Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> his ſonne <hi>Roſider</hi> with the bewteous <hi>Roſamonde,</hi> that with victorious courage did behaue her ſelfe, giuing no ſtroke but it felde an enemie into the déepe, that ſéeing they muſt die, had rather doo it by her hands, deuoured or conſumed, either in the water, or with fire. She eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> and followed him more then ſhe ſhould: for the <hi>Achayan</hi> ſéeing her ſo neare him, diſcharged a flouriſh on the beſt helme in both Nauies. It made the blood guſh through her mouth, and bende her head as lowe as her faire breaſt. Shée conceiued ſuch mortall hate againſt him for this blowe, that firſt the generall Gréeke warres ended, before it was extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe he ſcaped not vnpaide, for truſting to her Armes, (although <hi>Floraliza</hi> gaue her a fierce thruſt,) ſhe loſt not her intended blowe, which ſhe executed on the Pagans ſhield: which is no defence againſt it, for the blade is the beſt on all the earth: and therefore cleane in two it parted his ſhield, in whoſe making, <hi>Lupercio</hi> had ſhowne ſuch ſkil. It daunted the Sarazen Prince, for hée had neuer ſéene his Armor cut. Yet there ſtaied not the furious ſword, for lighting vpon one ſide of his Helme, cutting, it deſcended downe to the ſhoulder, where it loſt his force, making him ſtagger backe. And then ſhe would haue leapt into her aduerſaries ſhippe, had not then come againſt her, the Gyants of his guard, that made her violently retire. Idle were not Father and Sonne, behauing themſelues there like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> among the Phyliſtines.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, the two friends, <hi>Bramidoro</hi> of <hi>Cerdenia,</hi> and the ſtrong <hi>Brandafidel,</hi> with his flying vnaccuſtomed weapon, who ſometimes, with it, at one blow felde thrée of thoſe deformed Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. On the other ſide, was this ſhip likewiſe boorded, by the valiant Prince of <hi>Aſſiria,</hi> ſo fiercely, that had not the good <hi>Theban</hi> Duke bene neare to her, ſhée had bene entered: but his comming, with the Duke of <hi>Medynas,</hi> intercepted their aduerſaries from their purpoſe. Aſhamed was <hi>Bembo</hi> to be ſo repulſed, not knowing his aduerſary. Some paide dearly for his anger, for returning to his place, he met with <hi>Oliuias</hi> Louer, ſomething careleſſe of him, being carefully buſied againſt the Gyants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:93"/>With a downright blowe he ſtrooke him. The Pagans armes were not of ſuch weakneſſe, as that his blowes ſhould be receiued without warde, for it forced him to ſet his handes on the hatches of his ſhippes, and before he roſe or were ſuccoured, the <hi>Achayan</hi> ſeconded another, nothing inferior to the former. There is no <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Tyger that may be compared vnto the great Emperour, ſéeing his ſonne ſo vſed. He claſped his ſword ſtrongly twixt his hands, laying the waight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vpon his helme. Neuer til then, did the Sarazen féele ſuch a blowe, for his ſword flue out of his handes, and he ſet both knées on the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. At his riſing, a pellet of <hi>Brandifidels</hi> weapon, did hit him on the breaſt, and depriuing him of breath, made him recoyle backe. Well did the two brothers knowe him, but they could not deny their dutie vnto their Generall: and therefore togither they requited the Gyant with ſuch blowes, that ſtumbling backwards, he had like to haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: and had they bene able to reach his head, they had felde him: for fewe armes were like to theirs.</p>
               <p>With ſuch eager fury did <hi>Roſamond</hi> ſéeke <hi>Bembo,</hi> that ſhée did not reſpect the others ſtrokes, whom <hi>Brandafidell</hi> wel befriended with his terrible Mace: for with it, he ſtrooke aſide the two brothers, that brauely defended their partie: ſo that the wrathfull Ladie paſt along, and with both hands gaue the Sarazen Louer a mightie blowe. All the toppe of his helme with a great péece thereof, ſhe ſtrooke away, and wounding him a little, ſhe made him tremble like an Aſpen leafe. Ere the Pagan could turne himſelfe, putting forth her arme, ſhe gaue him a daungerous thruſt on the breaſt. His Armor and priuie coate it pearſt: and <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> ſaith, his fleſh felt the blade. But howſoeuer hée gaue backe yéelding from the ſword, a manifeſt token that hée feared the poynt. So well could not <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> and <hi>Brandafidels</hi> blowes defend her, but <hi>Floraliza</hi> founde opportunitie to giue her one with <hi>Camillas</hi> ſword about her helme, with all her ſtrength.

did owe (for the furious <hi>Bembo</hi> not ſéeing him, and méeting with a Gyant in his place) with both handes he gaue him ſo terrible a blowe, that he conſtrained him to ſet both knées on the ground. So buſied were father and ſonne againſt the <hi>Achayan,</hi> and another, that he had time to beſtowe another at his helme, it was with ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and diſcharged (as he could not more deſire) that he felde him all along vppon the hatches, to the aſtoniſhment of euery one that ſawe the Battle, to enioy whoſe ſight, many left their ſights, for of foure to foure, a fiercer Combat could not lightly be wiſhed. Readie to burſt with rage was <hi>Roſicler</hi> now, ſéeing the <hi>Achayan</hi> was onely he that diſturbed the entrance of that veſſell. He cloſed with him, and with both hands they either diſcharged vppon the other, ſuch puiſſant blowes, whoſe eccho was heard ouer all the fléete, the which, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies horror could not drowne.</p>
               <p>With much courteſie they receiued one another, bowing their heades verie lowe. So inraged was the Pagan ſéeing his ſhielde in péeces, and his head wounded, that it made him ſecond an other before <hi>Roſicler</hi> was readie. It was like one of thoſe he vſed to execute, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him touch the hatches with hands and knées. He could not adde any more, but raiſing his ſword, with it he reached <hi>Brandafidell</hi> (ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing him vnawares) vppon his armes: It was a miracle he did not cut them off, yet it inforced him to let go his Mace, dragging it along, not able to wylde his armes through paine.</p>
               <p>This did <hi>Trebatio</hi> well note, ending then the diſpatching of a Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to hell. At one ſteppe he confronted <hi>Bembo,</hi> whom before he could ſettle himſelfe, the Gréeke gaue ſo ſtrong a blowe, that maugre his might, he ſtrooke him away from him: and ſaide to his friendes, that their purſuing particular Combats, made them looſe the generall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, their enemies ſo much excéeding them in numbers.</p>
               <p>It was as the Emperour ſaid, for indéed they had the worſt, hauing euerie veſſell of their owne aſſaulted by thrée and foure of their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and yet the courage and vallour of the Chriſtians was ſuch, that it ſupplied the want of men. All had not bene ſufficient, had not at this time, ſome fiue houres before the ſetting of the Sunne, Eaſtward appeared at one inſtant, two proude Fléetes, that with a freſhe gale made towardes the Battle, not ſéeming any whit to aſſault eache other.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no content that might bee equalled to mine (fayreſt of all fayres) if I durſt but imagine you had with ſome pleaſure ouerpaſt the beginning of this Nauall conflict: the which fauour were ſoly ſufficient to adde thereto ſuch an ende, as euery worthy accident therein hapned did deſerue. For that Fléete which coaſted more along the ſhore, entered among the Pagans ſide, that for all they were ſo many, were not able to forbid it, nor to breake their order.</p>
               <p>This was the famous <hi>Abſtruſios</hi> Nauie (then who vpon the ſeas was neuer any more ſkilfuller) and bringing with him, ſo many men &amp; well furniſhed veſſelles, with an ifinit number of braue Knights, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing aloft the Gréeke armes, hee paſſed through his enemies with winde-blowne ſayles, and oares, in moſthorrible manner: crying <hi>Grecia,</hi> and his countrey. He kept ſuch good order, that ere he loſt it, he made mortall deſtruction on his enemies, for his ſmaller barkes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, where greater could dot, did nought but caſt wilde fire, melted pitch, and ſcalding Leade, which was preſent death to thoſe that onely defended themſelues with the ſword. Armed like <hi>Parthians,</hi> were <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſios</hi> followers with bowes and arrowes, wherewith before they fell to handy blowes, they bereft a number numberleſſe, of liues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:94"/>Which horror of ſhafts being paſt, it was admirable to ſée with what brauerie they betooke themſelues to their weapons. They were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert and exerciſed in warre, becauſe they liued in it continually, againſt theyr neigbouring Ilanders. Wherefore the Sea began a newe to floate with dead trunckes of men, with ſuch horrible outcries of the wounded, becauſe they could not before death reuenge themſelues, that there is no heart ſo ſtony and remorceleſſe, but would haue bene mooued to pittie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> that wiſhed to ſée riuers of purple goare, had here bene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied with ſight of ſeas of blood. The mightie generall <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> did ſet himſelfe vpon the hatches of his galeon, doing what <hi>Mars</hi> durſt not imagine: on either hand, <hi>Lyſart</hi> did accompany him, with his ſonne <hi>Floriſart,</hi> deſiring to make manifeſt their affection to the Gréeke. The Gyants that were appointed to guarde the fayre <hi>Serynda,</hi> were cyzed like tall high maſtes, clad all in ſteele, with Iron Maces in their hands. A better defended veſſell was not in all that Fléete: for not dreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it went forwards ſinking all it met. The furious <hi>Bembo</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſéene the mercileſſe deſtruction of his men and Gallies, had commaunded his to be vngrapled from the Gréeke Emperors, to ſend ſuccour where it moſt néeded. He was ſtraight eſpied by <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> that preſently ſent thoſe that followed him to boord her, leauing way for his encounter. The beake of whoſe Galleon was all of Iron, faſtened euen downe to her kéele, which made him preſume on more then was lawfull on the ſeas. So ſéeing how well his Gallies had aſſailed his aduerſaries, not omitting his intent, <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> entered with his, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſuch force againſt the ſide of his aduerſaries, that he ſplit her cleane in two, and had almoſt endangered himſelfe: for truſting to his ſtrength, he would haue leaped into her when ſhee began to ſinke, and they within her, cryed out for boates to ſaue themſelues. Oh <hi>Bembo,</hi> here diddeſt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to be whom thou art: for leaping into a ſmall Barge, he oppoſed himſelfe againſt <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> as if he were in as good a Galleon as his. The Pagan laughed at his folly, and noting him more narrowly, by his colours he knew him to be his enemies Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p>It gladded him, thinking to haue taken him priſoner. But the haughtie Louer that had his life reſerued to endure greater troubles, made his valour there knowne to the vttermoſt, and how in déeds of
<pb facs="tcp:13978:95"/>
armes he would be ſecond vnto none: for though he was beſet on all parts, he ſo beſtirred himſelfe, that neither his aduerſe Generall, nor <hi>Lyſarte,</hi> with his ſonnes power, could enforce him from his ſtanding. Preſently was he ſuccoured and taken into <hi>Lindauros</hi> Admirall, dyed in blood and ſo inraged, that he would ſpeake to none, nor any durſt looke on him. To be in ſuch vnaccuſtomed brunts amazed him, and more, not able to learne, nor geſſe whom his aduerſary was, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch deſtruction of his, had ſuccoured the Gréekes. From this imagination was he put, hearing the entry of the other Fléete nothing inferior to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Diuers were the voyces heard, for ſome cryed, <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> ſome <hi>Antioche,</hi> others <hi>Croatia,</hi> and all at once, <hi>Grecia,</hi> and then let flie ſuch volleyes of ſhaftes, that no leſſe hauocke they made, then <hi>Abſtruſio.</hi> Whoſe arriuall vtterly vanquiſhed that wing of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: And <hi>Sacridoros</hi> Admirall where <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> was, paſt cloſe by the Tower, which none elſe had done. It aſtonied both Father and Sonne, to looke vpon the two Competitors, <hi>Bramarant</hi> and <hi>Brufal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> who with their ponderous blades ſuffered none to approach the Arches: to doo the like arriued <hi>Bembo,</hi> making himſelfe ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Pillers that ſuſtained the Tower, where he animated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with gazing on the Ladie he moſt affected, that opening the Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then knowing none of them, had ſet her ſelfe to behold the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</p>
               <p>She appeared like the Sunne of Maye, in all his glorie, chaſing away the duſkie Clouds from about him, that would obſcure his brightneſſe. There was none in all the Fléetes but turned their eyes to gaze on her bewtie. Many knew her, whereof one was <hi>Oriſtoldo,</hi> who thus ſaid to his Father. This is the ſeaſon wherein we muſt procure to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate you Ladies thence. For the fayreſt of them is <hi>Lyriana,</hi> whoſe carrying from <hi>Nyquea,</hi> coſt our friend <hi>Roſabel</hi> and me ſo much blood, and more labor. And beléeue me not (dread Lord and Father) if theſe knights haue not purpoſely take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſtandings there, that none might proue the aſcending to the Tower.</p>
               <p>As they were thus talking, they deſcried two knights of rare diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, comming in ſeueral Barkes. The one was preſently knowne to be <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> whome (being departed from <hi>Pollidolpho) Nabato</hi> had guided thither. Of his helpe there was no néed: for the
<pb facs="tcp:13978:95"/>
Pagans had then the worſt: yet he entred as he was accuſtomed, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the frothy waues with dead carkaſſes. He aſſaulted no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knights, but the fierce Gyants. Quickly was <hi>Roſamond</hi> aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of his comming: whereat ſhe ſtraight commaunded her Royall Galley to waft her, where he was, ſhe met him. Her Armor was well knowne of euery one, and ſo her beloued <hi>Dacian</hi> alſo knew her. He leapt into her Galley, imbracing one another with intyre loue. It was no time for long diſcourſes, ſo hauing kiſt the Emperors handes, the two Louers began to performe ſuch déeds as were incredible, but not to thoſe that to their coſt beheld them.</p>
               <p>The other knight clad all in Roſe colour Armour, none as then knew: but approaching neare the Tower, and viewing his Lady, he conceiued ſuch content, that he ſuſpended his fight, til he had well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the poſſeſſor of his heart. He became ſo fierce with that ſole ſight, as he iudged nothing, the ſubduing of both Armies. Caſting his ſhield be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and taking <hi>Hectors</hi> ſword twixt both hands, at fewe blowes he was known to be <hi>Roſabel,</hi> to the excéeding content of all his friends. In this inchaunted Boate, he flung to the Arches of the Tower, but he found them ſo wel defenced, that neither his friend <hi>Ariſtoldos</hi> helpe, nor his owne ſtrength, could make his way to them: For the thrée fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous warriors being in a rancke, with ſuch brauery behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that euery one iudged the approching to the Pillers impoſſible. With <hi>Brauorant</hi> cloſed <hi>Lyrianas</hi> Louer, croſſing his ſword on high: nimbler he was then <hi>Scythian,</hi> and ſo with all his ſtrength before he could warde it, he diſcharged a furious blow on his helmet, the which had it not bene of ſuch force, euen with his head it had bene cleft, yet he forſt him two ſteppes backe. Into his Barke he would haue leapt: but the Pagan (inured to ſuch blowes, although it much gréeued him) returned, and with a thruſt droue him backe againe, as faſt as he came forward.</p>
               <p>Fewe blowes like vnto theſe had the Britaine felt, but ſéeing the Ladies looked on him, and alſo his Father, and Graundſyer, that were come thither, returned vnto his place, where he began one of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Combats of all that day. For againſt the other Barke wherein <hi>Bembo</hi> was, came <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> no leſſe furious then <hi>Mars:</hi> and <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldoro</hi> was confronted by the Emperor <hi>Alphebo.</hi> He y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt executed his blow, was haſty <hi>Dacian:</hi> ſo cloſe grapled were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barks, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could
<pb facs="tcp:13978:96"/>
fight as ſure as on land, and therefore <hi>Roſamonds</hi> beloued, with <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſword, flouriſhed it twiſe aloft. Well perceiued <hi>Bembo</hi> his intent, wherefore leauing his Helme bare, gaue him a ſtrong thruſt on his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous breaſt: the which taking him as he ſtifly ſtood, and with his minde another where, it was a great chaunce he ouerthrew him not, but made him ſtagger into his Barke. After him would the Pagan leape, but as ſwift as a Leopard returned the Louer, and ere he could doo it, with both hands he diſcharged his ſword, in ſuch manner on his helme, that he thought he ſawe more ſtarres then the heauens contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and bore ſo heauily on the one ſide, as he ſet his left knée vppon the ground. Another ſeconded the <hi>Dacian</hi> a little lower, deſcending downe the ſhoulder: a better blowe was not giuen in all the Battle, for it cut away all his Vanbrace, with his ſléeue of Male, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wounded him. The Pagan trembled at the blowe, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was he which ouerthrew him in <hi>Grecia,</hi> he animated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for he was greatly vexed to ſée his croſſe fortune, and beganne to ſhewe, he was no leſſe then <hi>Bembo,</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaya.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Alphebo</hi> that knewe his enemy, warily aſſayled him, although he quickly broke off order, for the Moore remembring him, will not vſe trickes of defence, but giue and receiue without pitie. So at once they laid on their helmes. Both kiſt the ground: the Emperour with one hand, but the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> with both, and both knées. The Gréeke ſeconded another, bearing his ſword outwards: which offer he had ſcarce made, when turning his hand, with all his ſtrength he thruſt at his breaſt: thence the poynt glaunced to indaunger the Moore, more: for if he had not yéelded to the thruſt, cleane through he had bin thruſt, for happening twixt the buckles, it ranne to the other ſide. None ſawe the blowe, but iudged either the Moore to be dead, or deadly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Who hauing eſcaped that great daunger, became more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then fire ſmothered within a Baſſeliſke, charged with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: And recouering his former place, caſting his Shield at his backe, beganne ſo with blowes to weary the Lorde of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> that almoſt hée could not fetch his breath: yet not in ſuch ſort, but he often aſtoniſhed the Moore, and made him to féele his ſtrength and fury of his armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:96"/>All this while was not <hi>Trebatios</hi> Nephew ydle, with <hi>Brauorant,</hi> the flower of Paganiſme, for their fight is woorthie the ſight of the towred Ladies. It was more dangerous for the Moore, becauſe the Louer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Ladie had knowne him. He neuer ſhewed himſelfe more ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller nor fiercer. Many particular battels were left, onely to beholde that of the ſixe. Both are well armed and ſure from beeing wounded, which made them feareleſſe abide one anothers ſtrokes. Like a chafed Bore fomed the <hi>Scythian,</hi> ſéeing ſo many aduerſaries to reſiſt him, and more they that could hazard his battel, as he that then was before him, who refuſing no labor, entred and retired at his pleaſure. Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and actiue was the Pagan, and ſo helping himſelfe therewith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Brittaine youth could turne about, he executed a blowe vpon the rich helme which <hi>Eufroniſa</hi> gaue him, whoſe fine temper ſaued his life, for elſe it had diuided him in two: yet it made him ſet his hands to the ground: ere hee roſe, the Pagan diſcharged againe a flouriſh on him, nothing inferior to the other. It was ſomewhat beſides his head, and not able to make impreſſion, it glanced away without more harm, although it had done ynough to inrage him. With more furie iſſues not the Tyger from his denne to ſeeke his pray, then he returned vpon the <hi>Scythian</hi> with <hi>Hectors</hi> ſword, ſtrongly claſped in both hands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue foure loſt the vermillion of their faces, ſeeing the feareful blow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, whoſe noyſe was heard ouer all the armies: his helme ſounded like a bell, and he voyded much blood through his mouth and noſtrels: and ſtaggerd vp and downe, not knowing where he was. With ſuch another hee helped him, which forced him in amazement, to ſet his hands and knées on the hatches of his barke, wherein he would haue leapt, if the two brothers, <hi>Don Celindo</hi> and <hi>Floraliza,</hi> had not there arriued.</p>
               <p>At once they both eagerly diſcharged two blowes on him, that hee was conſtrained to bow lower then he would Quicke and bolde was the Ladie, ſo would ſhe haue wonne the entrance of his veſſell, but ſhée had like to ouerthrowne her ſelfe: for the Emperors Admirall béeing neare thereto, and the haughtie <hi>Roſicler</hi> knowing his braue ſonne, and ſéeing him ſo ill vſed, like an Eagle leapt into his boate, ſaying. Courage braue Prince, for your father is with you. With the blowe he gaue, ſhe was forced backe, and for feare of falling into the ſea, ſhée withheld her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:97"/>His ſon could not anſwere him, ſo inraged he was, imagining ſome ſhew of cowardiſe had made his father come to ſuccor him. And his blood repaired to his heart, the which burning like fire, and cloſing barke to barke, leauing his father with <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> he turned his reuenge wholly vpon the Ladie, whoſe beautie deſerued no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camillas</hi> armie may ſhe thanke for her life, elſe this had béene her laſt battell and terme of breathing. Thrée ſteppes he made her ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger backewards, and followed her with ſo ſtrong a thruſt, that hee thruſt her ſo farre within the barke, that eaſily he wonne the entrance in deſpight of the Pagans. Excéeding danger doth <hi>Meridians</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incurre, fighting with <hi>Roſabell,</hi> with whom no Lyon may bee compared. Againe before the Ladie recouered her ſelfe, hee gaue her another that had almoſt felled her. Neuer was ſhe in ſuch perill: but he that loued her as his ſoule, <hi>Don Clariſell,</hi> (that long had ſought her) came thither in ſuch good time, as it was worth no leſſe then her life to her: who ſeeing his Ladie ſo handled, let flie a cruell thruſt at him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that had ſtrooke him, turned the Brittaine youth, giuing the Ladie leaue to riſe and breathe.</p>
               <p>Thither alſo arriued the furious forſaken <hi>Lindauro,</hi> with many mightie Gyants of his guard, and ſéeing the cruell fight, and knowing the Ladie (whom they all tendered) hee went againſt <hi>Roſicler,</hi> that hand to hand warred with <hi>Celindo:</hi> he entred betwéene them, parting both Barkes, whereby the brother and ſiſter turned both vpon <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi> He did not refuſe them, although the Aſſyrian troubled him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie time he reached him. On euerie ſide elſe of the battell, the Gréekes had plainly got the victorie, which they brauely maintained. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed the mightie <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> was he that wonne it, winning the title of an excellent Captaine, which he kept for euer. There wanted not them that tolde him newes of his deare friend <hi>Boſabels</hi> arriuall. It gladded his very ſoule, for as it he loued him. Him for gratitude doth <hi>Galtenor</hi> extoll aboue all the Princes in the world. Hee tolde it to his beloued <hi>Syrinda,</hi> ſaying. Let vs go to ayde our Prince (deare Ladie) for he that is ſo much indebted to him as we both, it is the leaſt we can do. His ſtrength and valour do I wiſh I had (replied ſhe) to imploy in the thing I moſt deſire. With an embrace the Pagan encouraged himſelfe, and commaunding his Galleon to be directed towardes the
<pb facs="tcp:13978:97"/>
Tower, in a trice he ruſht in among the Barks there. Eaſily he might haue ſuncke them, with the aduantage of his being the ſtrongeſt &amp; beſt in all the Fléetes, but yet he would not, ſaue enter them with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. By his manner of fight he knew his friend, wherevpon he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Galleon to the ſtout <hi>Lyſarte,</hi> that ſhewed himſelfe that day to be a good warriour.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke Louer wanted now no friends, for on the other ſide came the haughtie <hi>Oriſtoldo,</hi> all couered with Pagans blood. <hi>Abſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi> firſt arriued, whom euery one feared, ſéeing him ſo ſterne and mightie: from his owne to <hi>Roſabels</hi> ſhippe he leapt, pronouncing his proper name. It much contented him to haue ſuch a friend by his ſide. Little could <hi>Alicandros</hi> Nephewes winne at their hands: for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan merits not compariſon with leſſe then with <hi>Brauorant,</hi> and if hee haue any aduantage ouer him, it is more then is knowne. In his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault he ſtrooke <hi>Don Celindo</hi> on the helme: had he done it with aduiſe, it had béene the laſt, with the lateſt moment of his life: neuertheleſſe being beſides his head, it falleth him headlong downe. He claſped him twixt his armes, thinking eyther to kill or impriſon him. Either hée mought haue done, if the gallant <hi>Don Argante</hi> had not lept thither from his veſſell.</p>
               <p>Of haughtie courage was the youth, ſo vpon the Pagans barke he diſcharged a fierce blowe, which made him leaue <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> and tarne vpon him. Againſt them both would the Pagan defend himſelf, to his honour, had he place to wilde about his ſtrong armes: but there was ſuch little roome, as they were all heaped togither one vppon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet <hi>Roſabell</hi> brauely kéeping his ſtanding, I knowe not with whom I may compare him, vnleſſe it be with him whom Fortune ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted aboue all knights: who, while matters thus paſt to eternize the Gréekes fame, appeared in ſight of both armies, like the God of warre himſelfe, whoſe arriuall deſerueth farre more then another Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. How to the battel arriued the two Princes, <hi>Claramant</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiana:</hi> and what ende happened to the aduenture of the Tower.</head>
               <p>TIred with bloodie conflicts of ſterne warre, I now will returne me (faire Ladies) to Loues ſwéet pleaſing battels, whither brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thoſe two that haue the ſole preheminence ouer al others in armes, and onely to liberate the beauteous <hi>Lyriana,</hi> I ſhall not néed to craue your fauors thereto, for I truſt (though not all) ſome wil denie it me. This hope animates me to procéed in this laborinth, and commit the two princes to your protecting ſmiles. Plowing vp the billowes of the calme ſeas, they reſembled the glorious ſunne, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through the clowdes, diſplaying his firie rayes. As they approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <hi>Claramant</hi> ſaid.</p>
               <p>The world (braue Prince) is ſo full of your haughtie déeds, that there néeds no more triall to eternize them: wherefore let me intreate you at this time, to let me be formoſt in this attempt, that preſuming on your helpe, I may winne ſome honour by your ayde. Moſt warlike warrior (replied he) conſidering the neceſſitie, you ſhould not demand of me, what I ought to intreat of you: for where your axe hewes his paſſage, there my ſword is not required. So doo as you will, for I meane to kéepe where I am, to enioy the ſight of your déeds. And as I thinke, there is more to do at the Tower then any where elſe. He née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to haue ſaid ſo, for <hi>Galtenor</hi> that guided their barke, directed it thither.</p>
               <p>Straight did <hi>Trebatios</hi> vnknowne ſonne cloſe his beauer, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one foote on the edge of his veſſell, with his axe twixt both hands, he entred betwéene both armies, crying: <hi>Grecia, Grecia,</hi> that none might ſtrike him. There was none but much reioyced, ſéeing one with <hi>Theſeus</hi> axe at one end, and the other, with the beſt ſword in the world, defending his backe at the other. More furious did not <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſhewe himſelfe among the <hi>Cennaures,</hi> nor <hi>Theſeus</hi> beating at the brazen gates of Hell, then were the two Princes among thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:98"/>No blow doth the new <hi>Mars</hi> beſtowe, but riddes his father of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: who was ouerioyed with pleaſure, ſéeing the excellent diſpoſition, of them both. He expreſſed it to the two Gyants that were with him, ſaying. Haue you euer ſéene any knights of haughtier diſpoſition? cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit me, theſe be they will winne our victorie. I thinke no leſſe (ſaid the King of <hi>Cerdina</hi>) for excepting my Lord the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> I haue not beheld any of better conſtitution and ſhape of bodie then the formoſt. It is ſo (ſaid <hi>Brandafidell</hi>) but Ile be ſuretie for the other, that he will not for his part looſe any iot of the victorie. Why then (ſpake the Emperor <hi>Trebatio</hi>) let vs behold the triall of their brauerie. Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did they verifie it to bee true, for paſſing by the imperiall Admirall, and thinking the Emperor to be there, they did their dutie very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly.</p>
               <p>Swifter then the winde paſt their Barke forward, till it came euen where <hi>Roſabell</hi> was: round beſet with mightie enemies was the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie Brittaine, for <hi>Epirabio</hi> a valiant Pagan, with others, excéedingly troubled him. So was <hi>Abſtruſio</hi> by the reſt that were in the ſhippe, as is alreadie ſaid. Now <hi>Claramant</hi> arriued, and with a flouriſh ſwaying about his axe, hee ſtrooke the Pagan on the helme: it is too weake to defence the head, for with a big wound he was felled. To ſuccor him came the braue Aſſyrian Prince, who heere got nothing now, for the rigorous axe will not pardon Loue it ſelfe: the which was diſcharged on the midſt of his ſhield: It cleft it in two, and had not his armor béene <hi>Telimonios,</hi> his breaſt had béen ſo too: yet hee ſtumbled backwards, not knowing what he did. Then turned he vpon the two valiant brothers, reaching <hi>Floraliza</hi> beſides her helme: and although her beautie did not deſerue it, he made her ſtumble as ſhee would fall. At her did <hi>Roſabell</hi> let driue, felling her altogither on the gound. To helpe her haſted <hi>Don Argante,</hi> which was to no ſmall effect, hitting <hi>Claramant</hi> a venturous blow on his armes, making him looſe his, whoſe force could not but haue indaungered <hi>Don Celind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Like an angrie Lyon did the gallant <hi>Toriſiano</hi> ſet vpon <hi>Lyrianas</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>er, and giuing him on his helme a moſt fierce blow. It forced him touch the Barke with one hand.</p>
               <p>By this was <hi>Floraliza</hi> on his féete, who more furious then an <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canian</hi> beaſt, with both hands raiſed <hi>Camillas</hi> ſword, laying it on <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabell</hi> before he roſe. With a little more, ſhe had layde him along: yet
<pb facs="tcp:13978:99"/>
ſhe ſtayed to giue him a thruſt at his riſing, which ſhe did with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of her ſtrength, driuing him two ſteppes from her. Diſgraced was the Brittaine here, for either tripping one leg with another, or by the ſtrength of the blowe, he fell on his backe at <hi>Don Celindos</hi> féete. Who thinking he had occaſion by the front, would not omit it, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo ſtagger, he turned his ſword about ouer his head, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it at full on the Gréekes helme. Doubt do the wiſe men, to whether <hi>Roſabels</hi> fall may be attributed. It extreamly gréeued <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſio</hi> that was hard by him, then who was neuer Lyon more fierce.</p>
               <p>He met with <hi>Floraliza,</hi> that eagerly followed the Gréeke, on whoſe ſhield he layde the waight of his armes with his broad ſword, in ſuch manner, that beating it againſt her head, it left her ſenceleſſe. He had time to turne vpon <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> that would haue knéeled on the Brittaine, whom he gaue ſo mightie a ſtroke on his ſhoulders, that he inforced him backwards faſter then he came. Then gaue hée the Pagan his hand, who quickly got on his legges, and ſo at his pleaſure tooke his reuenge on the brothers, that they were fully requited with intereſt.</p>
               <p>In this ſeaſon was not <hi>Claridiano</hi> ſo ydle, as to witneſſe what his vnckle performed, for neuer any knight did better backe his friend. There was no Gyants durſt come neare the inchanted barke, but in ſatiſfaction of his preſumption, left his life in the handes of the one or other. Sometimes would <hi>Claramant</hi> hitting his enemie with his axe, ſtrike him euen to <hi>Claridianos</hi> ſtanding, who finiſhed the reckoning, bereauing him of his life, whoſe fortune brought him thither. The horror which was made there, ſéemed no leſſe then if the whole frame of heauen would fall: for all the famous Pagans repaired to the Tower, maintaining the battell in an equall ſtate where they were: but in all other places elſe, there was nothing heard but victorie for the Gréekes. Breaking through ſo many valiant aduerſaries ruſht the inchanted Barke, till it confronted <hi>Brufaldoros.</hi> It much pleaſed <hi>Claramant</hi> to beholde the Pagans diſpoſition, and with what furie hée defended his arch. With thouſands of dead bodies hee had ſtrewed the vaſt ſea, hauing thitherto with honor augmented his fame: but the blinde Goddeſſe intending altogither to fauor the Grecians, conducted thither the inuincible <hi>Claramant,</hi> all died with <hi>Sarazens</hi> blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:99"/>The Moore then ended the felling of the gallant <hi>Perſian</hi> on his Barke, to poore <hi>Laiſſas</hi> extream grief that beheld it: who quickly ſaw him pay for it dearly. For as the Barke paſt all the Chriſtian veſſels, made the warriour way, ſomewhat he might reuenge them for their ſuſtained diſgraces, and others (that waighed not their honours) becauſe they would not meddle with him. Many left their fights, hearing that the Knight of the <hi>Lyons</hi> combatted with him that kept the arches of the Tower. With freſh courage entred the famous combattants. Moſt nimble was the Moore, and knowing his enemies valor, with what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage he had with his axe, he purpoſed to procéed warily in this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and helpe himſelfe with that dexteritie the heauens had lent him. So with his ſhield on his arme, and his ſword poynting outwardes, ſtayed for him.</p>
               <p>The venturous youth did not reſpect nor care toward his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries blows, ſaue onely brandiſhed his axe about, letting it fall where it would, but <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> was no knight to bee aſſaulted ſo openly and careleſly, for letting the axe flie ouer his head, he ſet his knées on the ground, and in that manner he gaue the Prince ſo mightie a blowe on his left ſide. Had not his armor béene ſo ſure, in two hee had béen diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet it made him ſtagger as if hee would haue fallen on that ſide. This was the firſt and greateſt blowe that <hi>Claramant</hi> receiued. With more aduiſe he turned, and being well ſetled, whilded aloft his axe. All his trickes nor agilitie auayled the great <hi>Mauritanian</hi> king, for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the edge of his ſhield, all it reached was cut away, letting the cruel blow light on the Pagans temples. Neither armor nor inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can reſiſt the furious axe, for in ſight of the greateſt Princes and beſt knights of the world, the mightie K. of <hi>Mauritania</hi> with a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wound was felled all along vppon the hatches of his barke. Highly was the knight of the <hi>Lyons</hi> extolde by all the beholders, for they that knew <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> and at one blowe ſaw him on the ground, could not imagine whom his aduerſarie might be. With mightie furie did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barke paſſe forward as far as <hi>Bembo,</hi> at ſuch time as the proud Moore roſe in amaze, &amp; flinging to his enemie, in his place he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the haughtie <hi>Claridiano,</hi> repreſenting the ſterne God of battelles on the ſeas. Betwixt them both they began one of the fierceſt combats of that day: for the Pagan rores and blaſphemes againſt heauen, when thinking to be reuenged, he met who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he imagined not, being ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his coſt reſiſted by <hi>Claridiano,</hi> that many times he was ſtrooke ſenceleſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:100"/>Many gazed on their fight, iudging him and his companions of the Lyons, the flower of both armies. Quickly did the furious <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> attract all the ſpectators eyes after him, who then had like to haue incurred much danger, for bearing his ayme on <hi>Brauorant,</hi> the valiant <hi>Bembo</hi> ſtept vnder his armes, and in his paſſage gaue him a daungerous thruſt. There ſtayed the Barke, and ere the Gréek could turne about his axe, <hi>Achayan</hi> was ioyned to <hi>Claramant.</hi> The Pagan greatly fearing the Gréekes weapons, went as neare him as he could, and ſo reached at his ſword. With ſome amaze hee made him giue backe, elſe he had eaſily drawne it. <hi>Claridiano</hi> did by chance perceiue it, whereat with one ſtep he was with him. Neuer did two knights better ayde one another, then the kinſmen. At his armes he let flie a mightie blowe, it made him forget his hold of the ſword, and retire thrée ſteppes, helped thereto with an enuious thruſt. And hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his ſuccor, he returned very quicke vnto his firſt place. For the Aſſyrian and <hi>Don Argante</hi> were come thither, to both whom hée made knowne the valor of his perſon. More abaſhed then may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. <hi>Claramant</hi> retired a little backe (ſéeing what had happened him with <hi>Bembo</hi>) to fetch about his axe, which he did with ſuch furie, that it cauſed chil colde feare in the hearts of the furtheſt remooued, but not in the valiant <hi>Achayan,</hi> that nothing at all daunted, entred within him as he raiſed his weapon, and with his vtmoſt ſtrength he ſtrooke him on his thighes.</p>
               <p>A more troubleſome blowe had not the Gréek receiued, for the paine thereof made him looſe his. Wherevppon he would haue cloſed with him: but the mightie <hi>Bembo</hi> ſtriking his axe outwardes with his ſword, and before hee could defend himſelfe, hee diſcharged it on his helme. He made him ſet one knée on the ground, and ſée the leaſt ſtars in the firmament at broad day. Ere he could riſe, he ſtrooke him againe on the ſhoulders with no leſſe fierceneſſe. But all this cannot auayle him, to ſhunne what the cruel Miſtreſſe of inconſtant times had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créede againſt him.</p>
               <p>For the Gréeke being well recouered, and ſtrongly getting on his féete, with extreameſt furie of inraged wrath, with his remorceleſſe axe, he met the <hi>Achayans</hi> head. It cut away all the toppe, and a great péece on the ſide, and had killed him outright, ſtriking ſomthing lower: yet in a trance he felled him downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:100"/>And ſo brauely paſſed forth vnto the third Arche, defended by the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chiualrie. There was neither friend nor foe but admired y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of the Lyons fortitude. So well was he backed by his Cooſen, that his prayſes with his Vnckles merits, were ſung in an equal key. For there was no knight ſo hardie that durſt but imagine to interrupt their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſéeing their maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Within reach one of an other, approached the two warriers. Eyther by the ſole viewe eſtéemed his aduerſary. Brandiſhing his heauie blade, the Gran <hi>Campeons</hi> Nephew, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe for his defence, with ſuch aſpect, that I know not he, would not feare him.</p>
               <p>Now manner of fight would <hi>Claramant</hi> haue deuiſed againſt him, conſidering his wel knit ſinewes, and ſtrong compoſed members. There he repented that little pauſe, iudging it cowardiſe to make that ſmall ſtay. With his axe on his ſhoulder and his left foote forward, he went againſt his enemie, that with his ſword in both hands expected him in the ſame manner. A more fearefull ſpectacle was neuer ſéene: for moſt of the ſpectators dreading their ſight cloſed their eyes. So <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> made as if he would execute his blowe, but in the middeſt of his courſe he ſtayed his weapon, to take him vnawares, as he fetched it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout againe. Careleſſe was not the Scythian, but rather none like him, did with more warineſſe lay holde of aduantage in the proceſſe of his battels. And ſo perceiuing his aduerſaries intent, he cloſed with him ſo quickly, that when he would haue ſtrooke him, the Pagan had executed his blowe.</p>
               <p>There is no knight how valiant ſoeuer, that hauing receiued ſuch a one, durſt haue expected an other: for this forced the Prince back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards within his barke, and dragged his axe after him. A thouſand times would the Pagan haue leaped after him, which he left, becauſe he would not forſake his Arch. A brauer blowe in all that warre was not giuen, nor neuer did <hi>Claramant</hi> receiue a bigger, for it made the blood guſh from his noſe and noſtrels. So farre had the Pagan run within him, that he could not ſtrike him with his axe, but rather <hi>Bramarants</hi> fierce ſonne ſeconded it moſt mightily. Neuer did <hi>Trebatios</hi> haughtie ſonne do, what at this inſtant, which was by ſtepping aſide, to ſhun his aduerſaries ſtroke. And as he wiſhed it, ſo hee ſawe the ſtoute Pagan follow the furious waight of his blade. Wherat the Gréeke ſetled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on his left foote, and cruſhing one tooth with an other, with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb facs="tcp:13978:101"/>
of his ſtrength, he diſcharged his rage on his Helme. From it bounded the Axe, elſe it had battered all his head: neuertheleſſe the blowe ſo aſtoniſht him, that not knowing what he did, he ſtaggard as he would fall.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Claramant</hi> brauely leapt after him into his Barke: the like did <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and either ſuppoſing the other would not ſtrike him, they both at once executed two moſt puiſſant blowes. Altogither without féeling, they felled him. Little honour got the kinſmen by the déed, for being two, and of ſuch note, it was rather the Pagans glorie to be vanquiſhed at their hands. Scarce was the blowe diſcharged, when the Tower was all couered with a blacke thicke myſt, and with the ſame, with ſuch horror was a larum ſounded, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of the conflict. With thundring and lightnings, ſhrikes and hideous fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cries, and terrible claimours, were both Armies affrighted: the cauſe was, that <hi>Lupercio</hi> ſéeing how his hopes were by Fortune croſt, procured to obtaine by his Arte, what with ſo many thouſand men he could not get.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Nabato</hi> the Gréeke friend, that had more ſkil then he, with Nygromanticke ſpelles and Coniurations, diſſolued the others exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes, and ſo cleared the Tower as before. From whoſe higheſt top was a Ladder let downe, by which two knights might well get vp at once. Slow to doo it was not the valiant Gréeke, caſting his axe vpon his ſhoulder, at ſuch time as the ſtrong Pagan roſe from the ground. There is no Lyon miſſing his praie, more fiercer then he, for roaring like a bayted Bull ſéeing him with the axe aſcend, he would haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him: but <hi>Claridiano</hi> preuented it, confronting him, arme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt arme, and ſword againſt ſword, and with a braue thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſt him backe.</p>
               <p>Well did <hi>Branorant</hi> expreſſe his wrath by diſcharging his blade with both hands on the others rich helme, the fineſſe of whoſe temper, ſaued his life: yet it did not kéepe him from touching the grounde with his knées, voyding blood from his vyſor. Thither rowed amaine in their Barkes, came with inraged fury, the two luſtie warriours, <hi>Bembo,</hi> and <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> by whoſe comming, <hi>Claridiano</hi> had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much daunger, if they had entered: but the gallant <hi>Roſabel,</hi> that with <hi>Don Celindo</hi> and <hi>Floraliza</hi> combatted, hauing approched ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neare to <hi>Brauorants</hi> barke, he leapt into it, when <hi>Bembo</hi> arriued to
<pb facs="tcp:13978:101"/>
doo ſo. The Brytaine hindred him from it, driuing him away with a braue thruſt, not onely making him looſe his intent, but hopes of euer getting his deſires: For the magnanimious <hi>Dacian</hi> ruſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, interrupted <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> from ayding the Scythian. And ſo one with others beginning a fierce battell, the ſecond <hi>Mars Claramant</hi> had time to aſcend vp the ladder, not without much paine, for vnſéene of him by whom he was ſtrooke, he felt himſelfe mortally wounded. Vnto the top of the Tower he arriued, with more courage then <hi>Hector</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>middeſt the <hi>Myrmedons,</hi> where he was oppoſed by two deformed Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants with heauie Maces. But as <hi>Fortune</hi> had vowed to fauour him, like lightning he put himſelfe among them, with the beſt weapon the world contained. In middeſt of the Gallery he ſtretched him at length, which being broade inough, oh who were able diſtinctly to dylate the wonders he performed, ſwaying about his axe: for the Gyants onely are there to fight, from whence they draw ſtrength for their defence, and courage from their wounds: the which maketh our knight take the condition of a Lyon, aſſayling and retyring, like an Eagle in ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but the more hee toyles, the more doth it augment force in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, for their inchanment lies in tumbling downe the way <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> aſcended. Long endured not this ſtrife: for the Prince ſéeming to feare them, gaue a litle backe, wherat they eagerly followed him, which he well noting, ſet on him that came foremoſt, and méeting him right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ladder, he turned about his axe, with ſuch fury, that with it he feld the Giant ouer, who was neuer more ſéene. The Gréeke was of pregnant and ſharp vnderſtanding, ſo he ſtraight perceiuing the cauſe, which made him auoiding a blow of the ſuruiuer, cloſe with him, &amp; ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly hoyſting him aloft, tumbled him the ſame way his companion went. If all the frame of heauen and earth had fell, it could not haue cauſed more feare, then what ſurpryſed the hearts of euery one by the Gyants death. So wearie remained <hi>Claramant,</hi> that to eaſe himſelfe, he raiſed his Beauer, to breathe a while, and ſo he looked out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow on the battle, reioycing to ſée ſo many of his enemies veſſels to burne with fire. Long ſtood he not ſo, becauſe the wiſe <hi>Nabato</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Ladyes, iſſued out of an other fayre Gallery. The Gréeke had not till then (ſince his enchantment) ſéene any woman, which made him admire theſe fayres, iudging none might equall the cheefeſt of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:102"/>So the wiſe man approached, ſaying. Moſt excellent knight, you may account your ſelfe in more then I may well expreſſe, hauing ended ſuch an aduenture as this, onely reſerued for the valour of your perſon, and vertue of thoſe armes, the which vntill this inſtant, haue coſt you moſt deare: yet muſt you more indure, ſuſtaining many dangers about them: and therefore henceforth begin to take courage. And as for what you haue done for theſe Ladies, becauſe in part it concernes your ſelfe, they ſhall not néed to thanke you. And more in this matter I am not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſay till you ſhall looſe your libertie, recouering then both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, friends and wife. And while I liue, will I aſſiſt you to my power, for my Lyons ſake that is among you, whom I account as my ſonne.</p>
               <p>So for this time ceaſing, I commit vnto your victorious hands, <hi>Lyriana</hi> the faire princeſſe of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> eſpouſed vnto the valiant Gréek Prince <hi>Roſabell,</hi> that belowe expected her, brauely backing you with your deare friend. Hauing thus ſaid, he vaniſhed, &amp; <hi>Claramant</hi> taking the Lady by the hand, fairer then the ſun, he ledde her downe the ſteps, at the noiſe of ſuch ſwéete muſicke, that it much delighted both fléetes. Thither repaired moſt of the valianteſt Pagans, imagining the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ended.

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing helped them, for then <hi>Claramant</hi> deſcended with his Beauer clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe he would not be knowne by any.

               <p>Farre from him was not the glad youth, moſt ioyfull ſéeing his

Lady ſure from his enemies. She was deliuered to him with theſe words.</p>
               <p>I doo ſo much deſire your content (moſt valiant Prince,) that to procure it, I haue indeuoured to doo thus much: and ſo in ſigne that I will euer be your friend while life indures, I preſent you with the ſpoiles, onely due to your vallour. Whereto the Prince replied. Braue knight, I doo not ſo much eſtéeme the good you haue done me by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating my eſpowſe, although my life depended thereon, as the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and magnanimitie wherewith you doo it, which is ſo great, that I cannot requite, ſaue by perpetually acknowledging the debt you haue bound vs all in, and referre the ſatiſfaction to your owne merits, from whence this memorable act procéeds. The great hurleburly brake off their farther ſpéeches, whereat he returned, for the other Ladies and <hi>Roſabel</hi> with his in his armes, was conducted to the Chriſtians Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Admirall, where the Gréeke Emperour receiued them with the greateſt ioy in the worlde. Preſently was victorie proclaimed for the Gréekes: who being aſſured thereof, fought fiercer then at firſt.</p>
               <p>The ſunne with his abſence parted that more then wondrous Battle: and ſo the Pagans fearing their vtter ouerthrow, ſounded retrait, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the third part of their veſſelles ſwallowed by the ſea, with infinit number of Knights and Gyants. They entred into counſell to ſée what befitted them. Voyces were giuen altogither to ende the battle: but in the end they reſolued the contrary, becauſe their aduerſaries held For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by the hand, and thereuppon withdrew towards <hi>Nyquea,</hi> from whence with freſh ſupplies and new hoſtes, to turne vpon <hi>Grecia</hi> they reſolued. Some comfort was this to thoſe that were like to burſt with fury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bembo</hi> would not be cured, til the Souldan himſelfe intreated him. So madde was <hi>Brauorant,</hi> that none durſt looke him on the face. The wiſe man, conſolated and animated them, ſaying he did finde by his Art, that if there doo not come more ſupplies to <hi>Grecia,</hi> they ſhould ſurely conquere it: for their partie would be far augmented, by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of many more Princes much wronged by the Gréekes. With this they were appeaſed, although deſtitute of conſolation. Nothing ſo were the Gréekes, that all the night ſpent in ioy and pleaſure, not miſſing their loſt men, though they were very many.</p>
               <p>The Emperor with all his ſons, wold néeds paſſe into <hi>Abſtruſios</hi>

great and ſtrong Galleon, to doo him that fauour. Who requeſted the kiſſing of his handes, but the Emperor would not, and imbracing him, ſaid.</p>
               <p>If I had knowne we had bene all ſouldiers vnto ſo braue a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, I had with better hopes expected the happie ſucceſſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. What I did, in what degrée ſoeuer, (moſt mightie Monarche he replied) was through imagination of the great content I hoped would haue redowned by my ſeruice, the which I aſſure eternally vnto your Crowne. All the warlike Ladies aſſembled togither, where <hi>Archy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilora</hi> made her ſelfe knowne. The Emperour tooke her in his armes ſaying. In faith, beléeue me faire Quéene, our victorie hath bene too ſmall, ſince procured by ſuch hands. <hi>Roſamonde</hi> reioyced in her hart with her comming, for they intierly loued. Then the Emperor ſent for <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Layſſa,</hi> who brought with them their two litle daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe bewtie euery one admyred. There alſo the graund <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio</hi> greatly thanked <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> for his good aide. And euery one in generall, were buſied in the entertainment of ſo woorthie a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
               <p>Through all the Fléete, the Emperour commaunded the two knights to be ſought for, that had ended the aduenture: but not finding them, he was aduertiſed how they departed in the greateſt haſte poſſible. After them had the Emperor ſent, but that <hi>Nabato</hi> ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that would not depart without viſiting his <hi>Dacian,</hi> and ſpeake to the Emperor, who entertained him as his déeds and merites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p>He made reply according to his wiſedome, perſwading them not to gréeue for the two knights abſence, whom they ſhould ſée in other new contents, which the one ſhould conceiue vntil death, although the other, is ſo tormented with amorous cares, that the earth can affoord him no pleaſure, becauſe the giuer thereof is in this ſhippe. None could directly ſuſpect who he was, yet ſome iudged him to be <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and they were the two gallant Ladies, <hi>Roſamond</hi> and <hi>Archyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora,</hi> who was comforted with hope to ſée him in <hi>Grecia,</hi> where ſhe would aſſure him of his glorie, and how that if ſhe were beloued, he was no leſſe. It was preſently knowne by ſpies, how their enemies were withdrawne homewards. It nothing gréeued them, in that for <hi>Lyrianas</hi> ſake, they willingly would haue accorded to any good motion.
<pb facs="tcp:13978:103"/>
Before that <hi>Nabato</hi> departed, he aduertiſed them, they ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue theyr Hoſtes, for that they would returne vpon <hi>Crecia,</hi> with the greateſt powers on the earth, againſt which the fierce Lyoneſſe would riſe, ſtirred vp by the Ruſſet Lyon. With this he tooke his leaue of the Gréekes, leauing them much bound vnto him. A great while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd with <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> to whome he declared the cauſe of the future warre, and that ſince he was the greateſt cauſe thereof, he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to make knowne the vtmoſt of his vallor: becauſe that partie which ſhould moſt reſpect him, would moſt oppreſſe him, and would many times put him in imminent daungers of his life, yet all ſhould honorably ende, to his laſting fame, and <hi>Roſamonds.</hi> So he imbraced him, vaniſhing far from thence.</p>
               <p>The next morning, the victorious Gréekes in tryumphant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner made towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hauing finiſhed the famouſeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall fight that was heard or read of. Forewards did King <hi>Sacridoro</hi> put forth, to be the firſt ſhould beare thoſe happy tydings vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, which he accordingly performed. And with proſperous windes, not long after they arriued all at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in whoſe welcome, there happened what the next Chapter ſhall declare.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:104"/>Such thicke ſmoake of ſmothering fiery myſts, raiſed the diſcharged ordinance in wel ordred peales, that one veſſel could not diſcerne the other. Which paſt, the Gallies and Shippes beganne to ſhowe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, daring the windes with their proude ſtreamers, and all their toppes with dauncing Banners made of ſilke, whoſe méeting diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the aire, rauiſhed the beholding ſences with ioy: which on the other ſide, was a corſiue to the hearts of the afflicted priſoners, ſéeing theirs as trophies of the victorie, ſet vp among their aduerſaries. The eccho on the water of mellodious harmony of concordant Muſicke, was a comfort to the poore wounded ſouldiers, who were all commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the warlike Troians charge.</p>
               <p>The diſcréet Citizens were not all this while careleſſe, but rather in preparations to feaſt their Prince had bene moſt carefull. All the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Citie welcommed them according to their vſuall cuſtome, placing on the higheſt of euery one, the Emperours Imperiall ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards.</p>
               <p>To the ſea ſide came all the gallant youthes brauely Armed, and euery one a blew ſcarfe, and in their hands ſwords and daggers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſkirmiged as they went. In two parts they diuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to take the Princes in the middle, that then were comming forth of <hi>Abſtruſios</hi> Admirall. A moſt faire Bridge they ſet vp, from the Galleon to the ſhore, with many ſtately Arches, all couered with gréen cloth of golde, and they with many curious Pictures, containing all the Gréeke Princes Battles and aduentures. Who iſſued foorth in this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt marched the Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> betwéene his two ſonnes, repreſenting ſuch Maieſtie and chearfull ſemblance, that therewith his ſubiects were much gladded. A little behinde them, appeared thoſe thrée Myrrors of beawtie, <hi>Lyriana, Archyſilora,</hi> and <hi>Roſamond,</hi> who to pleaſe the Princeſſe of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> had put off their ſtrong abille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of warre.</p>
               <p>They were all thrée attyred in gréene, cut vpon cloth of ſiluer, and tackte with knottes of Pearle, and betwéene euery cut, a button of rich Dyamonds: on whoſe ſparkeling light, the reuerberating ſun da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeling thereon, depriued the beholders of the Ladies ſight. Large &amp; wide were their garments, with long ſléeues hanging to the ground, all rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Embrodered, euen much like the faſhion now vſed in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:104"/>Other ſhorter they woare on their arms, laced ouer with great Orient Pearles, with cuts drawne through with fineſt cloath of Golde, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with white and crimſon, according to the vſance of the Parthians. Their diſheueld hayre dangled downe in tramels, whereon, there is not any, but would haue hung thereon a thouſand ſoules, and iudge them too fewe for their merits. To conclude, they were ſo excéeding ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in all perfections, that <hi>Apollo</hi> bluſhed to bee excelled in bewtie by humane creatures, who to enioy the contemplation of their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſurfet in imaginary conceits of their rarieties, curbed with his raignes, the haſtie galloping of his fierce and vnſtayed ſtéeds. A little after them, followed other thrée, no leſſe bewtifull then they. Theſe wer the gallant <hi>Venus,</hi> the braue <hi>Layſſa,</hi> with the faire <hi>Syrinda.</hi> They would not change colour, and therefore were all in Crimſon, cut vpon Golde.</p>
               <p>Next to them, the excellent Empreſſe, <hi>Claridiana,</hi> attired accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her Maieſticke ſtate and grauitie: yet with ſuch exquiſit bewty, that the former ſixe became enuious of her faire. She paſſed on with the mightie <hi>Abſtruſio,</hi> whom all the Gréekes much affected. The reſt of the ladies were al richly apparelled. At the end of the bridge, vpon a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant arch, ſtood thrée images, moſt liuely repreſenting the firſt thrée ladies. Not far from them, thrée Syrens, with Amber treſſes dangling to the ground came forth, and playing on ſeuerall Harpes, ſung ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall notes one after the other, thus.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The third, with no leſſe ſwéetneſſe, remembred <hi>Roſamond,</hi> in this manner.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Hauing all ended, they recorded them togither, with ſuch recording voyces, to the conſort of their delightfull muſick, nothing different from <hi>Angels</hi> harmony. And as they went vnder it, from the opening of a Cloude, ſpredde vnder the Arch, after a tempeſt of artificall thunder and lightening, there raigned downe, an odoriferous ſhewer of ſwéete water-dewed fragrant flowers, whoſe comfortable odour, reuiued all their ſea-weakened mindes.</p>
               <p>Before they had paſſed it, from the thickeſt of the ſame Cloude, there deſcended thrée mightie Eagles, eyther with a coronet of flowers in their billes: and whipping the ayre with their great winges: they with them, crowned the thrée moſt gallant Ladies. So ſoone as they were gone by, and <hi>Venus</hi> with her company come thither, the thrée Syrens, to a new dulced tune, with one voyce ſung this note.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The twelue Gouernors of the Empire, with all the courtiers and gallants of the Cittie, expected their landing at the ſhore: where twelue auncient Peeres, clad in long robes of cloath of Golde tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the ground, tooke the ſixe Ladies vnder a cannabie, whoſe value excéeded eſtimation, and in that equipage marched forward, till they ſtayed to behold a Caſtle, erected and drawne on foure whéeles: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they rung a larum bell, crying, <hi>Nyquea, Nyquea:</hi> aduancing on the higheſt of the ſame, thrée Enſignes, with the Ladies armes.</p>
               <p>Then in rich Armour iſſued out thereof, thrée well accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Knights, who aloude made a challenge, to maintaine they were the Paragons for bewtie and fortitude. There wanted not ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to defend the contrarie: for from the ſame Caſtle came foorth nine knights, betwéene whom, they began a braue combat at barriers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:105"/>Then beganne the Caſtle to mooue, diſcharging ſo many fireworkes, as if it were al on a flame. The Ladies wold not mount on horeſeback, becauſe they were very neare the chiefe gate of the Cittie, through which the <hi>Theban</hi> Duke iſſued foorth with the imperial Enſigne: who intreated the Ladies in the Cittizens behalfe, to diſpoſe of the Citie as their natural Lords. They returnd their tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes according to their ſtates, highly eſtéeming of their ſolemne entertainment, which had ſo excéedingly contented <hi>Lyriana,</hi> that ſhee accounted all her forepaſſed troubles well beſtowed, ſince they had brought her to ſo happie ende. In all the Court there was not any but came to ſée the arriuall of their Princes. In opinion was the Ladies beautie had, whether of the thrée was faireſt: for <hi>Lyrianas</hi> ſight had attracted all eyes. And in no leſſe admiration were the others had.</p>
               <p>Such preſſe of people were in the ſtréetes, that had not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours guard gone before, they had not béene able to paſſe. But beeing entred into the yard, new matters did happen, for an alarum bell was with furie rung in <hi>Lyndabrides</hi> inchantment: which ended, they heard a moſt heauenly noyſe of ſwéet muſick. Ther was none but demanded the cauſe of that vnaccuſtomed accident. Whereto the wiſemen aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. That by reaſon of the <hi>Nyquean</hi> Princeſſe comming, the gates were opened, that euerie one that would, might fréely prooue the aduenture. Very great pleaſure conceiued the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> thereat: ſo did the grand <hi>Alphebo,</hi> imagining the end of the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was at hand, ſo much by them deſired.</p>
               <p>I do omit (faire Ladies) to ſhunne prolixitie, their newe welcomes in the Hall: onely remembring <hi>Oliuas</hi> ioy, with the ſight of <hi>Lyriana</hi> and her ſonne <hi>Roſabell,</hi> whom alſo with the other Ladies, ſonnes, and kiſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Empreſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> moſt kindly entertained. Few daies after, was the Brittaine Prince, with the Princeſſe of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> married by the Patriach of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being firſt baptized, which ſacred and diuine Sacrament, <hi>Roſamond</hi> would alſo receiue, for her dear Lords ſake.</p>
               <p>New triumphs had béen ordained, but that the proofe of the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Tower did intercept them: for as the promiſed reward was ſo great, euery one procured moſt, to ſhew himſelfe moſt forward in that aduenture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:106"/>Dinner being done, there wanted no knights that offered the trial, but as it required ſuch great valour, ere the ſunne ſetting, there was hung about the Tower, aboue two hundreth Shieldes, euery one placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Maiſters deſerts. Drowne would <hi>Apollo</hi> his cleare light, in <hi>Thetis</hi> watery lappe, when through the place there entered a gallant and well accompliſhed Knight, clad in roſe colour Armour, and brauely mounted. His diſpoſition pleaſed euery one. Who gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping along, leaped from his ſaddle, and with admirable brauery paſſed into the Tower. Many ſuſpected he would end the aduenture, ſéeing with what courage hee aſcended the defended ſteps. But foure he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when vnable to goe any further, hee was ſenceleſſe caſt from the Tower, hauing his Shéelde ſet very neare vnto the haughtie <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This knight was a valiant Pagan Lord, of <hi>Leſbos</hi> Ile, not farre from <hi>Troy.</hi> Who hauing landed a little after the Ladies came thither, at ſuch time, that he well made knowne the proweſſe of his perſon. Scarce had this ſtout Pagan loſt his entrance, but <hi>Lyriamandros</hi> haughtie ſonne, named <hi>Terſildo,</hi> preſented himſelfe, to be no leſſe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant then frée from the vnweildie yoake of of loue. His Armour was of Azure colour, with many ſtarres of Golde. In the middeſt of his ſhield, was portrayed a knight treading on <hi>Cupid,</hi> hauing his Bow and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer broken: with this Motto.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Loue reſiſted is a childe,</l>

               </q>
               <p>There was no Lady there, but gréeued at his frée deuice, nor neuer did they more wiſh any knights vanquiſhment, as this: thinking it was an iniurie vnto their ſexe, to haue him liue at libertie. Quickly was their deſire ſatiſfied: for proouing the entrance, he did couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly arriue as farre as the Pagan, whence with like violence hee was caſt forth: whoſe vnhappie chance did greatly pleaſe all the Ladies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb facs="tcp:13978:106"/>
The nights approach with ſable couerture, taking her place in <hi>Phoebus</hi> abſence, brake off the inſtant tryall: whereupon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with his company returned to the Pallace, where was open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling.</p>

How <hi>Claridiano</hi> and <hi>Claramant</hi> arriued at the Port of <hi>Rotta,</hi> where they founde the ſtraunge enchauntment of <hi>Roſelia,</hi> and what haughtie deedes of Chiualrie they there performed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Alphebo, Brauorant,</hi> and <hi>Don Celindo.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lowing the foming Billowes of the vaſt déepe ſea, with their inchaunted barke (moſt bewtious dames) we left <hi>Claridiano</hi> and <hi>Claramant,</hi> with no ſmall ioy, for the good ſucceſſe of the valiant Gréekes, and yet much wondred at the litle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Nyquean Souldan, had not to accept as his ſonne in law (whom <hi>Darius</hi> would not haue refuſed) the famous Britaine <hi>Roſabell,</hi> Competitor with <hi>Mars</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in armes: and for ſtate and royaltie, equall to the Gréeke Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Alexander.</hi> Of theſe &amp; ſuch like matters did the two Gréeke war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors diſcourſe, admirnig to behold, with what ſwiftneſſe their barke
<pb facs="tcp:13978:107"/>
cut through the ſwelling waues. And to ſée whether they could diſcern any Hauen or Arbor, not long after they deſcried one, the fayreſt and ſafeſt that they euer ſawe, the which <hi>Claridiano</hi> ouerioyed thereat, tolde his vnckle it was the famous Port of <hi>Rotta,</hi> thrée myles from the renowned Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereat they deſired to land, becauſe they wiſhed to ſée a place ſo glorious as that.</p>
               <p>Theyr will was quickly accompliſhed, for the Barke with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Vellocitie came a ſhore in the ſame Hauen, where the Princes imagined they were to abide: whereupon landing and mounting on theyr Horſes, they tooke theyr beſt way to <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Claridiano</hi> partly knew, hauing before bene there. And croſſing a great wood, they came into a fayre playne all dyaperd with <hi>Floras</hi> fragrant Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ouer which an Imperious Caſtle ſéemed to commaund: whoſe loftie heigth and topleſſe Pyramedes, controwled the ſtarry Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In middeſt thereof, ſtood an Alabaſter Tower, fiue wayes ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the workemanſhip thereof, greatneſſe and altitude, amazed the Princes. At euery edge of the ſquare, it had thrée Bulwarkes of fineſt Iaſper, ſo that the middle Tower was incompaſſed with fiftéen Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes. Round about, it was Moted, with a broad déepe Ditch, ouer which, fel a draw Bridge, to paſſe it: at the fartheſt ende thereof, there ſtood a mightie big Chriſtal Piller, on which hung by Chaines of gold, fiue rich Hornes, a litle beneath, a Table with Letters, that yéelded ſuch ſplendor, as they almoſt depriued the beholders ſight. Greatly did the Prince wonder at the ſtraunge rich Edefice, and ſo <hi>Claramant</hi> ſaid.</p>
               <p>Truly (moſt excellent Prince) this ſéemes to be a moſt gallant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, if we may iudge it by the ſtrong fortefied bigneſſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Tower, and Bulwarkes, whoſe like, mine eyes til now did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet behold: nor is it poſſible they ſhould againe ſee ſuch another.</p>
               <p>And therefore I much deſire to reade the Letters of the Table, if you ſo thinke it good, to be certified therof, for leaſt I be deceiued, this ſhould be ſome Inchauntment: and if it be, of no ſmal eſtéeme ſhould the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inchaunted be of. Anſwere would <hi>Claridiano,</hi> when through the aire they heard a hideous noyſe, by the riſing of a ſudden whirlewind, with ſuch horror, that it ſéemed to leade a Legion of diuels after it, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the way deſolate by which it paſt, renting by the rootes all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pines,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:107"/>
oakes and elmes it met. This ſight confounded the Princes, who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to ſée the ende, they ſawe a blacke fogge riſe ouer the ditch, whoſe obſcure aſpect, depriued <hi>Tytan</hi> of his bright rayes: but a litle after, the Welkin cleared, and <hi>Apollo</hi> being reſtored to his former light, they diſcerned the Bridge raiſed aboue ten faddome high, hindering the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ouer: and on this ſide, there was placed an other Piller, but of Braſſe, with an inſcription of Emerald Letters, that ſignified the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture. Not ſpeaking one to another, they went to the Piller, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned all maner of languages, they could reade this in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tongue thus.</p>
               <q>Let none, (though <hi>Mars</hi> in Armes) be ſo daring as to pretend the libertie of <hi>Roſelia,</hi> vnleſſe they be fiue Warriors, whoſe famous deeds haue through the world extended their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie: for till they ſhall be togither in this Forreſt, the paſſage ouer the Moate ſhall be graunted to none.</q>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Claridiano</hi> tooke occaſion thus to ſpeake vnto his vnckle. I thinke (heroicke Prince) it is in vaine for vs to offer to proue the aduenture, ſéeing the words ſay, there ſhould bee fiue that muſt doo it togither. Oh how ſhould I reioyce, were we now accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the ſtrength of <hi>Paganiſme, Brauorant, Bembo,</hi> and <hi>Brufal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> that we might vndertake this enterpriſe: but ſéeing the wiſe men haue thus ordered it, let vs if you pleaſe, go vnto the populous Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> where you ſhall ſée ſuch antiquities, that without admyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you cannot behold.</p>
               <p>Be it as you haue ſaid (mightie Lord) replied <hi>Claramant,</hi> for I wil in all things obey you. As theſe famous Princes of <hi>Greece</hi> were about to tread the next way to the Cittie, they heard a great noyſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea coaſt, as if many knights were in battle togither, whoſe horror of vncontrowled blowes, was no leſſe then that of <hi>Vulcans <hi>Aetnean</hi>
                  </hi> worke-houſe. Slow were not they that were borne to fight, in pricking their ſwift ſtéeds thitherward: and hauing croſt the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt hard by the ſhore in a fayre plaine, they ſawe two ſturdie knights in Combat one againſt the other. A third of no leſſe gallantneſſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and leaning on his ſpeare, beheld them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:108"/>To him went <hi>Mars</hi> his Competitors, and after due courteſie, <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> thus ſaid. You ſhall not a little fauour vs Sir knight, to let vs know the cauſe of ſo terrible fight, which in mine opinion, will not coſt leſſe, then eythers life, with ſuch furie they proſecute it. So much haue your kinde words bound me, (Sir knight anſwered hee) that I cannot in honour denie to ſatiſfie all your demaund. Know therefore, that you bigge knight in Ruſſet armor, is called <hi>Brauorant,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt that this day breathes: who hauing taken part with the Souldan of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> in his laſt expedition againſt <hi>Grecia,</hi> where he loſt moſt of his ſhips and men in the Nauall battell, as no doubt you haue heard: this knight left him of purpoſe, to ſayle vnto his kingdome, to aſſemble new powers againſt the Gréekes on the Souldans behalfe, hauing ſworne vtterly to diſtroy them. And I, <hi>Don Celindo</hi> by name, deſirous to ſée the high déedes of this moſt famous warrier, did offer my ſelfe to aſſociate him, which hee refuſed not. So to morrowe will bee eight dayes, wee departed from the Souldans Fléete, in a well rigged ſhippe.</p>
               <p>Long ſayled we not with proſperous weather, but were by a cruell ſtorme caſt on this ſhore: where finding this Knight, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt (as his fame memorateth) that euer the ſpacious worlde hath known, we knew him ſtraight to bee the Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> of <hi>Trebizond</hi> (for treacherous <hi>Luperſio</hi> had conducted him thither to end his deſire.) Whom <hi>Brauorant</hi> knowing to haue beene on the Grecians ſide, and remembring the waight of his cruel blowes, did on the inſtant challenge him: and for this ſlight occaſion, they ſo batter and mangle one an others Armor and fleſh.</p>
               <p>No longer ſtayed <hi>Claridiano,</hi> but vnderſtanding that knight to bee his father, drew forth his ſworde and ſtepped betwéene them, with theſe words. Withholde braue Knights, for ſo fierce a quarrell is not lawfull on ſo ſmall occaſion, ſince the loſſe of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil be a noted want vnto the world. Whereat the courteous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror leauing, replied.</p>
               <p>In faith (braue Knight) were it but onely in reſpect of your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpéech, I would haue done it: how much the more, when I winne thereby, wanting an equall eſtimation with this knights va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:108"/>How milde the Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, being mildly, vſed, &amp; how tractable is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die expreſt: who now hearing his aduerſaries gentle words, did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly make his anſwer to the Emperor. So greatly haue your frendly words inchayned me to your obeyſance (moſt mightie Lord) that thogh this knight had not requeſted it, I would haue deſiſted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, eſpecially, it being my aduantage, conſidering how Fame throgh euerie mouth blazoneth your woorth, and my vnwoorthineſſe. As <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridianas</hi> Lord would haue aunſwered, <hi>Claramant</hi> intercepted him thus.</p>
               <p>If (moſt valiant knights) the greateſt part of your rigorous battel, hath béene to manifeſt vnto the world the rareneſſe of your vnmatched ſtrength, wherewith the heauens hath armed you, then go with vs, where there is occaſion offered, whereon you may more ſecurely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your redoubted valors in lawful attempts of braueſt armes, which may be vndertaken with more ſufficient reaſons, then you began this your ſlender quarrell. For know, that at the end of this Forreſt, in the middeſt of a faire plaine, we found a Fortreſſe, which we iudge to bee the ſtrongeſt on the earth, and reading certaine letters inſculped in a Table, we perceiued it to be the inchauntment of the Princeſſe <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> daughter to the Emperor of this land: and more, that none but fiue knights togither, whoſe fame the world ſhould report to be admirable, ſhould prooue the aduenture. Wherefore ſince you be they (according to the conditions required) it were vniuſt we ſhould neglect the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſo great a Princeſſe. And although my companions merits and mine owne, be not in the leaſt degrée, ſuch as the aduenture challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, it ſhal ſatiſfie vs to march vnder the ſhadow of ſuch woorthies, to end a more harder enterpriſe. Whereto <hi>Alphebo</hi> replied. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to offer my perſon to the proofe, although in me there bée nothing meriting your praiſe: but the controuerſie had with this knight, hath béen ynough to teach mee to imitate his valor. I, &amp; to haue ſtolne ſome part thereof from him to incourage me to this attempt. It ſhall not be left for me, (ſaid <hi>Don Celindo</hi>) for in the company of ſuch knights, the hardeſt is the eaſieſt to be atchiued. Then <hi>Brauorant,</hi> it is not lawfull the libertie of ſo great a Ladie ſhould be remitted through my meanes, although my fame nothing deſerues your eſtimation. Then let vs no longer delay the triall of ſo happie a proofe (ſaid <hi>Claridiano:</hi>) who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſpurred his ſwift Courſer, leading the way vnto the braue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment.
<pb facs="tcp:13978:109"/>
Followed he was by the flower of armes: that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in ſhort ſpace arriued at the déepe mote, where they admired the greatneſſe and exquiſit workmanſhip of the Caſtle, whoſe like they accorded the world contained not: eſpecially when <hi>Alphebo</hi> ſaide, it excelled that of <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> where he diſinchanted his father, as in the firſt of the firſt part of this great Hiſtorie. No ſooner were theſe valiant warriors arriued, when the draw-bridge (that yet ſtood on high) was let downe, which hauing paſt, they ſtept to the Piller whereon the hornes hung. The ingrauen ſcrowle of the Table they thus read.</p>
               <q>When the fiue warriours the aduenture doth require, ſhall bee here togither, if they be of ſuch daring hearts, as to prooue it, let each of them hang one of theſe hornes about his necke, and winding them, the Caſtle gates ſhall be opened, and they may enter.</q>
               <p>In performance thereof, theſe mightie Princes were nothing ſlow, but euery one louingly imbraced one another, they each of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelues before either of the Caſtles, whoſe gates preſently flew open at the ſhrill founding of the hornes, the eccho whereof, was alſo heard within the Citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> Throgh the doore that befel vnto the inuincible <hi>Alphebo,</hi> iſſued a deformed vgly big Gyant, mounted on a luſtie Courſer, with a ſtrong knottie lance in his hand, hauing a pike of well tempered ſtéele, aboue two handfuls in length.</p>
               <p>Him <hi>Alphebo</hi> receiued with the ſwifteſt running of his horſe, the like did the Gyant, with ſuch furie as the earth could ſcarce beare them. They met ſo ſtrongly, that the gyants big lance flew in péeces, againſt the inpenetrable ſhield of the knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> whoſe ſhiuers hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the ayre, mounted higher then the proude toppe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment.</p>
               <p>The Gyants mightie ſpeare was not of ſtrength to pearce <hi>Alphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos</hi> thield, the which was reſiſted by the magicke ſpelles wherewith <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> had forged it: yet was hee caſt backwards ouer his ſaddle bowe, looſing the raines out of his hand. I know not to what I ſhall compare the Emperour of <hi>Trebezounds</hi> incounter: for hitting the gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in middeſt of his ſhield, he pearced it, togither with the plates of ſtéele, and priuie coate, whoſe inchaunted power vnable to defend the
<pb facs="tcp:13978:109"/>
lance guided by ſo braue an arme, he ran it through his left ſide, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounding him directly on his heart, againſt which the ſtrong ſpeare bending, he broke it, and leauing a péece in the wound, the reſt flew into the middle region of the ayre. So paſſing forward, they met with ſuch a ſhocke, that it deſerues eternall memorie: for as the two warriors, incountred ſhield againſt ſhield, and bodie with bodie, the haughtie knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> firſt ranne againſt the Gyant vpon the ſpeares trunchion, which hee ſo vehemently thruſt through his bodie, that it cleft into his miſerable heart: yet he ſcapt not ſo frée, but felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo bruſed on his <hi>Corneryno,</hi> that the poore horſe was driuen to ſtrike his buttockes on the ground, along whoſe backe his Maiſter fel, in ſuch amazement, that he knew not whether he was in heauen or on earth.</p>
               <p>But recouering himſelf, and iudging it cowardiſe, he ſet ſpurres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his horſe, which made him fetch light carreirs vppon the ground. And looking after his aduerſarie, he ſawe him lie vpon the earth, voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his blood as through a riuer: by him lay his horſe with his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der broken, and both at one inſtant accompanied each other in death. A little reioyced not the courteous Emperor at his ſpéedie good ſucceſſe, and after his due thankes to God for his victorie, would not procéede vntill the end of <hi>Brouorants</hi> battell, whom hee iudged one of the beſt knights of the world, wherein hee nothing deceiued himſelfe. Who hauing ſounded the rich horne, whereat the Gates burſt open, whence came foorth a well proportioned Gyant, both brauely mounted and clad in defenſiue armes, with a huge mace of ſeldſéene greatneſſe in his hands.</p>
               <p>Againſt him made <hi>Bramarants</hi> ſonne, brandiſhing his launce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his head: ſo did the Gyant with his mace: but in the méeting, <hi>Campeons</hi> Nephew miſt his incounter, running his ſpeare through the head of his aduerſaries horſe, who as <hi>Brauarant</hi> paſt by him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging his mace with ſuch ſtrength in the middeſt of his ſhield, the which (though inchanted) it battered and deſcended to his helm: where it fell ſo heauily, that maugre his courage, it made him bend his head below his breſt, and voyde much blood.</p>
               <p>There is no Lyon crueller, nor chafed Bull more furious then is now the inuincible <hi>Scythian:</hi> for hauing wel recouered his ſeat, &amp; drawing foorth his ſlycing blade, with more fierceneſſe then a thunderbolte, hée looked for his enemie, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw on féet, with his mace aloft. Againſt
<pb facs="tcp:13978:110"/>
him hee went, but firſt brauely leapt from his horſe, and griping his ſword ſtrongly twixt his hands, he neglected to watch his aduantage, but let flie at the Gyant: ſo did he, and at once executed two blowes woorthie ſuch warriors.</p>
               <p>Venturous was the Gyants blowe, for lighting on his enemies helme, although it could not breake the inchantment, it forced him to tumble headlong on the paued floore, where hee thought he ſawe the twinckling of more ſtarres then is in the firmament. The Gyant had no time to vaunt of his victorious blow, for with another nothing inferior, his ſhield was cut in two, through which the ſword deſcended to his helme, cutting away all the one ſide thereof, with all the top, the which had it fell right, his head had béene cleft in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt: yet fell he to the ground on his hands, amazed with the ſtroke. The haughtie Emperor not a litle admired the ſtrength of the combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, much eſtéeming the Gyant, conſidering <hi>Brauorants</hi> diſgrace: whom he animated, (though néedleſſe) with theſe words. Courage braue warrior, for there is much to doo: but making the world knowe the vtmoſt of your ſingular valor, with it we ſhall eaſily liberate the Princeſſe <hi>Roſelia.</hi> Though almoſt choked with chollor, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt himſelfe, (for no God he confeſt) hee turned his head at thoſe words, and ſéeing the Knight of the Sunne not fighting, becauſe he had alreadie killed the gyant, there is no tongue able to explicate the furie that entred the fierce Pagans breaſt, ſuppoſing that knight excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, when he would not acknowledge <hi>Mars</hi> any ſuperioritie. And accounting it baſe fearfulneſſe to let a ſingle combat indure to the third blowe, foming through the mouth, he raiſed his ſword and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gyant, that was alreadie vp: who well noted with what furie he came, and truſting to his Mace, croſt it ouerhead, whereon fell the ſtrongeſt blow beſtowed in his time. For being poſſeſt with the vtmoſt of extreameſt rage, &amp; <hi>Brauorants</hi> ſon deſirous to make known the might of his arme, hee diſcharged on him a fierce ſtroke worthie his valor) which falling on the mace, (whoſe inchauntment being of no force) it cut it like as it were of wood, and ſliding to the ſhoulder, where his armor was not able to reſiſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſharpnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword, (guided by the ſtrongeſt arme that euer the Gyantiue nation knewe) it ſliced him in the middeſt, diuiding the brutiſh bodie in two parts: which déede the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> ſo admired, as he iudged him to be ſonne to ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:13978:110"/>
father. Litle had the fierce Pagan thought he had done, wherevpon like an infernall furie he entred the gate.</p>
               <p>All this while was not the Heroicke <hi>Claridiano</hi> ydle, for in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Portall, at the ſhrilneſſe of the horne, there iſſued foorth a mightie <hi>Centaure,</hi> with a big dart in his right hand, and in the other a chaine, by which he ledde a cruell Lyon. This ſight daunted not the ſecond <hi>Mars,</hi> but ſwifter then a Roe he prickt againſt the <hi>Centaure,</hi> that expected him, brandiſhing his ſtéely dart, the which, ere the prince came neare him, hee flung at him with all the ſtrength of his arme, it ranne through the ſhield, and wounded him a little on the breaſt, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his armor, whoſe inchauntment could not withſtand the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſpeare.</p>
               <p>The Prince hit the <hi>Centaure</hi> in the middeſt of his breaſt with ſuch puiſſance, that had not his plates of fine tempered ſtéele, (wherewith he was armed) defended him, he had béene then ſlaine, yet he ſo thruſt him backe, that ſtaggering vp and downe, hee fell on the ground, at ſuch time as his horſe paſt on, which ſtumbling on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Centaure,</hi> fel ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the earth, where it had coſt <hi>Claridiano</hi> no leſſe then the price of his life, had he not vſed his dexteritie, wherewith hee leapt at one ſide from off his back before hee fell, the which ſcarcely touched the ground, when the cruell Lyon with his pawes ſeyzed on him, and rent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder péece by péece, which much auailed for the Princes victorie, for whileſt the Lyon deuoured the horſe, he diſcharged at his pleaſure the waight of his armes vpon his head, of the which, as much as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſword did take, was cut away: yet the blowe was not ſufficient to kil him outright, but rather roring amaine, it forced him leaue his pray to flie at <hi>Claridiano,</hi> cloſing with him ſo ſpéedily, that he could not ſhunne him, but with his ſharpe clawes helde him ſo hard, that hee cruſht his crimſon blood through his armor, gryping him cloſer then doth the little <hi>Remora</hi> cleaue to the kéele of any ſhippe, to hinder her ſwift courſe.</p>
               <p>In great anguiſh of minde was the warlike Gréeke all this while, féeling himſelfe ſo faſt bound betwéene the Lyons fangs, and ſéeing the <hi>Centaure</hi> come againſt him with a heauie naked ſword. No remedie found <hi>Mars</hi> his Competitor, but to draw his dagger, and ſtabbing it into his bellie, forced the Lyon with the pangs of death to leaue him, the which méeting with the <hi>Centaure,</hi> not knowing what it did, catcht
<pb facs="tcp:13978:111"/>
at his breſt, which with his clawes he rent, letting foorth riuers of blood through his mortal wound. Whereat the fierce <hi>Centau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaking the Prince, raiſed his blade on high, and with it diuided the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in two. Which done, trailing the one halfe with him, he marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Claridiano,</hi> who wondring at the ſight, did ſo too, and on his ſhield tooke the beaſts blowe, which he requited with a poynt that he thruſt at him, which penetrating his plates of ſtéele, wounded him to the death.</p>
               <p>Roaring like a Bull, the Infernal Monſter towred his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, which when he would deſcend, he was ſtaied in the midſt of his courſe, by the remorceleſſe ſtroke of death: whereat he fel downe, at the time that <hi>Claridiano</hi> thanked his God for the victorie. And imagining his companions were afore him, he paſt on through the gate. No leſſe fierce was <hi>Claramants</hi> renowned battle, for in the end of the hornes ſhril ſound, there appeared a wel diſpoſed knight, richly armed and mounted, bearing a Launce in his hand, and a big Cemitor at his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle bow. Our new <hi>Mars</hi> nothing feared him, but ſpurred his horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and méeting in middle of their courſe, their ſhiuered laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces flew into the ayre, giuing place vnto the furious ſhocke of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne was faine to get about his horſe neck, for feare of falling, hauing almoſt loſt his bridle: but recouering his ſeat, he ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aduerſarie lie on the ground, groueling vnder his horſe, ſtriuing to get from it.</p>
               <p>Courteous was <hi>Claramant,</hi> and ſo alighted to helpe his enemie, which kindneſſe he had like to haue dearly bought, for through the gate that the knight iſſued foorth, flew out a hideous terrible Griffon, who ſuddainly ſurpriſing the Prince, claſped his bodie about, and with his ſharpe tallents cruſhed his armor within his fleſh, and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fluttring his wings aloft, raiſed him a litle, purpoſing to haue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on high, and then to let him fall, and beate him in péeces againſt the ſtones.</p>
               <p>It happened not as the beaſt intended: for the Prince noting how treacherouſly he had béene aſſayled, and féeling his fleſh bruſed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and his armor with his owne blood bedewed, ſtretcht foorth his armes on high, more inraged then an angred Tyger, and getting hold by his wings, pluckt him downe, making him looſe his pretended flight, and ſo both fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:111"/>And the haughtie Gréeke being of great force, turned vppon him, where refuſing to vſe any of his weapons, being extreame wrathfull, hee ſeized on either wing, which with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength, hee pluckt away by the rootes, leauing the truncke without motion, voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inuenombde gore from the wounds. Hee performed not this ſo ſafely, but he had his helme cleft in two, &amp; a ſmall wound on the head, the which the vgly beaſt had done with his inchanted bill, whoſe death preuented his further daunger.</p>
               <p>By this was the knight recouered, and with his ſhield and ſword marched againſt the Prince, but what auales it: for <hi>Bryanas</hi> ſonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwelled with wrath, tarried for him, with his axe, who directed a blowe towards the diſarmed part of his head. The angrie Prince would not receiue it, becauſe he would not indanger his life, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at one ſide, gaue place vnto his enemies blowes, whoſe ſword ranne almoſt to the middeſt into the ground, and he himſelfe followed it.</p>
               <p>The occaſion would not <hi>Claramant</hi> forgo, but like a Fawlcon at his pray, ſtept to him, and with his axe ſtrooke him to the earth, where hée tumbled vp and downe. So <hi>Claramant</hi> deſirous to make an ende, cloſed with him. But the knight with the feare of death pluckt him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon himſelfe by the ſkirt of his armor, making him looſe his blowe, and caſting his armes about him, thought to get ſome ground of him: but the vnhappie knight miſſing his purpoſe, the gallant Prince helde him faſt, and ſetting one knée vpon his breaſt, with his dagger opened a paſſage through it for his hatefull life, ſending him to bee waſted ouer the infernall poole, by the blacke Ferry-man of hell. Thankes did hée render to the god of his father for the victorie, and without further ſtay, as he would paſſe on, he heard a great crie, and turning his head, hée ſawe it was a Gyant dragd about the féeles by his horſe, with one leg hanging in his ſtirrope.</p>
               <p>The cauſe was, that <hi>Don Celindo</hi> hauing winded his horne, and his Caſtle opening, that Gyant on a mightie Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer iſſued foorth.</p>
               <p>Agaifiſt him went <hi>Alicandros</hi> Nephew, but bing ouer eager, miſt his incounter, and was by the Gyant ſtrooke along his horſe backe. Either paſt by the other brauely ſet in his ſeate, where drawing
<pb facs="tcp:13978:112"/>
their ſtrong ſwords, they laide ſuch loade vppon their battered creſts, renting their armor, and mangling their fleſh, vntill the Gyant ſlipt his bodie aſide, to auoyde a blowe that <hi>Don Celindo</hi> let flie at him, reentring with a ſtrong poynt with all his ſtrength. This offer of the Gyants got him no leſſe then the victorie: for the inhumane wretch miſt his thruſt, and running the ſword betwéen his armes, it ſlid down the armor, bringing the Gyants head vpon <hi>Don Celindos</hi> horſe neck, inclining it downwards, who ſéeing him ſo neare, and not omitting ſo good opportunitie, ſtrooke him on the helme with his ſword hilts, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing him on that ſide he moſt declined, which was the occaſion of his fall from his horſe, and thinking to haue ſtayed himſelfe, thruſt one leg ſo farre into the ſtirrope, that when he would, he could not draw it foorth: whereat the Gyant noting his diſgrace, drew his dagger, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cut it, but ſo vnfortunate he was, that ſomewhat annoyed with the former blow, he mortally wounded his horſe bellie with the ſtroke, the which féeling it, with extreame pangs of death, fetching a Carreir, ranne about the field dragging his maiſter after him, where both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at once, leauing <hi>Celindo</hi> thanking Fortune and his Gods for his good ſucceſſe. Through the gates of thoſe Towers that befel them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred he &amp; <hi>Claramant,</hi> and yet not with ſuch haſt as <hi>Claridianas</hi> Lord, that hauing ſéene <hi>Brauorants</hi> good hap, no longer delaying the time, fearing to be out gone, he paſt on til he came to a large yard of ſtrange worke. And round about it, there was a Gallery ſupported with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pillers of cleare Chriſtall. In the midſt of it, ſtood a faire Fountaine, diſtilling water through diuers pipes, incompaſſed with Roſe Trées, and other Odoriferous flowers. On the top of the Fount, there was a rich and precious Armor of ineſtimable value, lying vppon a Table of ſiluer, with twelue féete of gold, whereat hung a braue ſword. At the entrance to the yard, ſtood a reaſonable Piller of Braſſe, wheron was written certaine words with Letters of Rubies. No further would <hi>Trebatios</hi> eldeſt ſonne paſſe, til he had read the ſcrowle, containing thus.</p>
               <q>What Knight ſoeuer would ende the Aduenture, it behooues him ere he paſſe farther, to win theſe Armes, for conſidering the keepers, he ſhall haue need of them: But if his courage failes to do it, let him go on, for the paſſage is free.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:112"/>So great pleaſure and liking he conceiued of the armor, that although he had not intended to proſecute the aduenture, hee would haue ſpent a thouſand liues to obtaine them, ſuch was his valour. Then couering himſelfe with his ſhield, and vnſheathing his ſword, hee entered the yarde, and going towards the Fountaine, he ſaw it guarded with ſo horrible a Serpent, able to affray any but <hi>Alphebo.</hi> Shee was of a ſpeares length, and a brace in breadth. Foure feete ſhe had, and two armes, armed with nayles of ſtéele, a handfull long: and téeth too of that kinde.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Serpents, do ancient writers make mention, to be dull, heauie, and drowſie: inſomuch, that no ſmall noiſe will eaſily awaken them. A while ſtood the Emperor ſtill, to ſée if ſhe would riſe: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſlouthfull ſléepe, he went more neare her, greatly wondring at her horred fierceneſſe, miſdoubting humane ſtrength againſt ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a monſter. But his heroicke breſt, beeing vnacquainted with any feare, recommended his ſafetie to the ſupreme King of Kings, and with his ſword ſtrooke the vgly beaſt on her defenſiue ſcales, whereat, with helliſh horror ſhe awaked. Againſt her went he when ſhe being on her féete, with her ſcaly tayle, ſhe ſtrooke him ſo fierce a blowe on his body, that the Gréeke ſtaggering, had like to haue fallen, but that his backe ſtumbled at the Piller, where he ſtayed. This much inraged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who like a Bazeliſke awaighted her, he auoiding an other ſtroke wherewith ſhe approached him, and then he diſcharged his blade in all poſſible haſte, vpon her ribbes: but it happened not as he thought, for the ſword rebounded backe, vnable to batter her ſcales, at whoſe ſtrength he much wondred: and being about to ſecond a poynt, ſhee entered vpon him: raiſing aloft her armes. Careleſſe was not the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and miſliking her embracements, wreathed aſide his body, and as ſhe would haue cloſed, he turned his ſword, and therewith cut away her hinder legges, making her fall flat on her buttockes, howling at the paine of her wound. And lifting vp her truncke on her armes, ſwoong about her tayle, and hitting him on the ſhoulders, ſhe felde him on his handes, and as hee roſe, got holde of his Armour with her nailes, and (furious with paine) rent away halfe of his armor, and had not he bene warie to looke to himſelfe, with her téeth ſhée had made an ende of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:113"/>But he ſéeing halfe his body diſarmed, and fearing a diſaſtrous death, ſhooke himſelfe from her, hauing two péeces of his armor ſticking in her iawes, imbrued in his purple blood, that iſſued from the wounds ſhe had made him. There is no furie of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> like to <hi>Claridianas</hi> Louer, ſéeing the yarde beſprinckled with his blood, and himſelfe vnarmed: that taking his ſword in both hands, on the Serpents backe, he executed the braueſt blowe that euer knight performed: for happening in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of her body, and the ſtrong ſcales vnable to reſiſt the ſharpeſſe of the blade, guided by the beſt arme in the world, ſhe was parted in two, and the gates of her life opened to entertaine the fréezing ayre of colde death. Infinit deſerued thankes rendered the Gréek to his Creator for the victorie: and taking off his torne Armour, hee went to the bubling Fountaine, and being vexed with thirſt, drunke of the Chriſtaline wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, remaining as well and luſtie, as if he were neither wounded nor had fought, bleſſing the water and he that made it. But looking on the armes, hee ſawe them to bee the richeſt hee had euer before ſéene.</p>
               <p>They were of ruſſet colour, full of white and redde ſtars, made of Dyamonds and Rubies, inchained one by an other, with knots of Golde. The ſhéeld did nothing differ from them. In middeſt of it, was the picture of a Knight, naturally reſembling the knight of the Sunne, when he maintained the bewtie of <hi>Lyndabrides,</hi> vnder the tytle of the knight of the Chariot, as the firſt part of this Hiſtorie remembred. Hee was alſo mounted on a horſe, the counterfeyt of <hi>Corneryno.</hi> The mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>His power cannot be withſtood,</l>
                  <l>That hath horſe, armes, and cauſe ſo good.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Slowe was not he to arme himſelfe with theſe armes, and hauing in mind the libertie of <hi>Roſelia,</hi> like a whirle-winde he paſſed through a doore he found in the yarde.</p>
               <p>All this while, the furious <hi>Brauorant</hi> was not: idle for hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his firſt battle, he entered the gate from whence the Gyant came forth. Through Lymbo he thought he walked, ſo excéeding darke was his way.</p>
               <p>A great while did he grope about the wall on eyther ſide, to find
<pb facs="tcp:13978:113"/>
and iſſue from that dwelling, vntill he found a doore: the which, althogh it was of ſtrongeſt ſteele, yet he quickly battered it with the pummell of his ſword. Forward he paſſed, and in the end, he found himſelfe to be at the gate of a faire hall, in middeſt whereof, there ſtoode the confuſed picture of a mightie Gyant, made of Braſſe, with a ſword in one hand, and in the other, a bigge ſhéeld: and as the ſtoute Scythian would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, the Fantaſmo made againſt him. No whit at all was <hi>Cmpeons</hi> nephew afraid, yet ſtood in great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion, not knowing in what maner to make his battle.</p>
               <p>Firſt arriued the Fantaſmo, and with incredible force executed his blowe on <hi>Brauorant</hi> Helme: who hauing no ſhéeld to ward it, was conſtrained to ſet his knées and one hand to the ground. A poynt was ſeconded with ſo ſtrong a thruſt, that hitting him as he was diſordered, it laid him along vpon his backe. Vpon him went the Fantaſmo, yet miſt of his intent. For the ſtrong Scythian did caſt his armes about his necke, felling him to the floore, and in the fal, being within his reach, he gaue him ſuch a blow on the miſhapen face with his fiſt, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he rowled him along the ground: and rayfing himſelfe, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vgly ſhape, that being vp did the like: but hee auoyding a blowe, with a flooriſh on high, he deſcended his cutting blade, paring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome of the ſhoulder, and halfe his arme. Which no ſooner was done, but that part turned into an vgly Gyant, who hauing a Mace of Iron in his hand, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Thinke not (fierce knight) thy ſtrength able to end the aduenture, for all the vnited power of the vniuerſe ſhall not frée thée from my hands.</p>
               <p>Much amazed was the ſterue ſonne of <hi>Bramarant,</hi> ſéeing the Gyant before him, yet with moſt inuincible courage hee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe for the Combat, and ſo comming towards him, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſtrike at his head, which made him lift his Clubbe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. But <hi>Brauorant</hi> withdrawing backe his ſtrong arme, ſtepped in with his right legge, and ranne at him with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thruſt. It cut all his Armour, and mortally wounded him on the belly.</p>
               <p>Vnrecompenced went hee not away: for the Gyant ſwaying his Mace about, hee ſtrooke him therewith on the breaſt, and felde him to the earth, but hee quickly roſe, ready to burſt with rage,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:114"/>
blaſpheming againſt himſelfe, from which paſſion he was put, by the approach of the <hi>Phantaſmo</hi> that came to wound him. But he ſcaping it, would turne his edge vpon him, but with the backe of his ſword he ſtrooke him on the helme, that it made him ſtagger a good way from thence, and then ſwifter then an Eagle, receiuing the Gyants blow on his blade, it cut his Mace of Iron cleane in two. Which when <hi>Florali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas</hi> Louer ſpied, he cloſed with him, and croſſing his legges with the others, he brauely tript him downe, felling him on his backe, and then he ſtabde his dagger into his brutiſh breaſt, making him belch forth his ſoule to him that long before that expected it.</p>
               <p>Now could not the vallerous youth ſo cleanly go away with this good hap, but that he was hit on the helme a heauy blow by the <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmo,</hi> the fine temper thereof ſaued his life, yet was he in a traunce laid along. On the ſhoulder the inchaunted ſhapeleſſe Picture ſeconded another, which made him tumble on the grounde, and as he went to thruſt at him a furious poynt, he got on his féete, but ſo blinde with rage, that forgetting what had befallen, he tooke his ſword in both ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength, he diſcharged it vpon his ſhoulder, diuiding the Phantaſmo cleane in two. He had ſcarce executed the blow, but the couragious Pagan repented him thereof, for each part of the accurſed Phantaſmo, turned to a mightie Lyon, whoſe ferocitie could not but haue feared any other ſaue <hi>Brauorant.</hi> It amated the Pagan, yet not that he fainted, but with more brauery then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, held the point of his ſword before him, letting the beaſts come, whereof one thirſting for his praie, ranne vpon his ſword, ſplitting his heart in two thereon. The other aſſayled him on his left ſide, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no reſiſtance, faſtened his clawes on him: and although his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor was ſtrong, yet he pearſt them, renting his fleſh within, which but more kindled his fury, ſéeing his blood there ſhead, which til then had happened in no fight be fore. <hi>Bramarants</hi> ſonne would not immitate <hi>Sampſon</hi> in that action, becauſe it ſhould not be ſaid he followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but rather performed an act no leſſe memorable, for letting his ſword hang by the Chaine at his wriſt, he tooke the Lyon by the necke twixt his hands, and with incomparable ſtrength choaked him, himſelf remaining both wounded, and with his Armor rent. There is no ioy like to his, hauing ended that perillous Combat, and although he was weary, yet went he forward, fearing his companions would be before
<pb facs="tcp:13978:114"/>
him. No leſſe famous were <hi>Claridianos</hi> battles: for vanquiſhing the kéepers of the firſt Caſtle, like a whirlewinde he paſt on, making ſtaie at a litle narrow Lane, ſéeming to haue no end on no ſide.</p>
               <p>Amazed was <hi>Archyſiloras</hi> gallant, at the obſcuritie thereof, yet he went on, and comming to the ende, vnawares he did tread in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low place, falling into a Vawte, filled with nothing but Wormes, and venemous Vermine. It was but ſixe yardes broade, and eight long: It yéelded no more light, then what iſſued at a litle caſement, where he eſpied a verie olde man, ſwarter then Chimnies ſoothe, who with a hoarſe voyce ſaid.</p>
               <p>In faith (braue knight) you haue got verie good company among thoſe Wormes, on them you may execute your reuenge: but I feare they wil firſt take it on you with their venome: and therfore your beſt way is not to ſtrike them, if you wil not be ſlaine: for tis better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue your life a litle, then nothing to enioy it. Excéeding great was the Princes wrath, ſéeing himſelfe ſo betraied into that peſtilentiall Caue, and hauing vnderſtood the Magitians words, blinde with rage he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Small is the Conqueſt, got by ſuch treachery, thus to betray any knight: which aſſures me, that he (which made this Inchauntment) was more inured to treaſons then good déeds, ſéeing without battles, by vndeſent ſtratagems, he proſecutes his diuelliſh intent and purpoſe. Why then, that I may ſée how thy words will agrée with your déeds (ſaid the infernal Coniurer) there be within that place, two beaſts, to whom all the reſt acknowledge their obedience. Now if thou beeſt ſo hardie as to incounter with them, on their deaths depends thy libertie: elſe art thou for euer there incloſed. Although extreame wrathful, yet glad in ſome reſpect, <hi>Trebatios</hi> Nephew anſwered.</p>
               <p>I am content to hazard my perſon in any daunger to iſſue hence, and for an inſtance thereof, ſhewe me the way I muſt goe foorth, and then place the beaſts there. Be it ſo (returned the Magitian) and in yonder dark corner there is an iron King, the which if thou doeſt pluck at, thou ſhalt deſcry whence the beaſtes doo iſſue. Slacke was not the Princely Gréeke to goe thither, and getting holde of the King, hée pluckt ſo hard, that drawing a Plancke from the Wall, hée fell backwardes, with it almoſt vppon him, but fearing the ſuddain comming of the beaſts, he quickly got on his féete: when againſt him
<pb facs="tcp:13978:115"/>
there came a Monſter of ſtraunge ſhape. His bodie was proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like a Beare, ſaue that he had a long Tayle, and crooked téethe, like Tuſkes, and on his head, he had a horne neare a yarde long. His armes were nothing differing from a mans, being footed lyke a Lyon. In one hand he beare a Bowe readie bended, with a ſtéele Darte. And in the other, he had a Chaine, which tyed a mightie Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeliſke.</p>
               <p>Nothing daunted with the ſight, was <hi>Claridiano,</hi> although a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle amated at theyr fierceneſſe: but hauing an eye at the Darte, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſword, and couering himſelfe wel with his ſhield, he marched againſt the vgly miſhapen Monſter. Who ſhooting his Darte, did make it flie ſwifter then lightning. The Prince warded himſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it on his ſhield. And then the Monſter hauing ſo done, he let looſe his Companion, marching both togither againſt the Prince. He alſo incountred them, and méeting firſt with the Monſter, he let flie at his head, ſtriking away halfe his horne, with all his Iawes on that ſide. Before he could ſecond it, the Bazeliſke with his ſtéely Bill, ſtrooke him vnder his arme, that it made him ſtagger thrée or foure ſteppes, and ſtumbling on the wall, ſaued himſelfe from falling. In manifeſt daunger of his life was the Gréeke, for the wounded Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter roring with paine, cloſed with the Prince (ere he could recouer his laſt miſchaunce) and caſting his armes about him, would haue pluckt him backwards.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Alphebos</hi> ſonne could no otherwiſe but doo the like, and hauing greater ſtrength, and being more nimbler then the Monſter, ſlipt one arme betwéene his legges, and hoyſting him aloft, he flung him to the earth on his backe, and as he drew his Dagger to ende with him, the furious Bazeliſke fluttering his winges, flewe on his ſhoulders, where with infernal fury, with his inchaunted Bill hée ſtrooke the Prince on the head, that it made him looſe his blowe and that good occaſion, and with his helme clouen, felde him a toſide. In whiche ſeaſon, the Monſter roſe, ſpitting fire through his helliſhe mouth.</p>
               <p>Straight did <hi>Claridianas</hi> ſonne riſe, but being halfe aſtoniſhed of the blowe, the Monſter had time to runne at his breaſt with his broken horne, which made him ſo recoyle backe, that he had much adoo to ſaue himſelfe from a fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:115"/>But what auailes it, all being for theyr worſt: for the Prince (ſtifeled with rage) tooke his Dagger in his one hand, and not knowing what he did, aimed it at the Bazeliſke that came flying at him. Straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Monſter ſhot his Darte, he flung it, and hitting him in the breaſt, it ſtaied not til it cleft his heart in two, and flying out at his backe, fel with the beaſt at once, that with a hiddeous ſhrike ſtird no more.</p>
               <p>This death greatly diſpleaſed the Monſter, who bellowing, and ſpitting ſulphure flames, leapt to the Prince that ſet his ſwords point againſt him, the which he tooke betwéene his tuſhes, and riſing on foote, would haue pluckt by the Princes ſkirt, but that he ſaued it with his ſhield, through which, as if it had bene of ſome compoſed clay, he thruſt his clawes into it.</p>
               <p>The haughtie warriour did let it go, and raiſing his right hand, (letting his ſword hang by the Chain, the which he had alreadie drawn from the Monſters mouth) he would néedes make the Magitian wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his vnequalled ſtrength, for cloſing his armed fiſt, he gaue the deformed Monſter ſuch a buffet, as he ſtrewed all his face with his owne braines, making his eyes flie from the head, and he himſelfe bellowing, fall dead at his féete: to the Princes excéeding ioy, though not to the Magitians, that woulde not any longer ſtaie in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe. Whereat the victorious youth without farther delaie, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be outgone by the reſt, paſt the doore he had ſo dearely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</p>
               <p>Admirable were theſe battles of the ſecond Caſtles, that hapned to <hi>Alphebo, Brauorant,</hi> and <hi>Claridiano:</hi> yet nothing inferior to them, was heroicke <hi>Claramants,</hi> for hauing done with the firſt, he ſtepped through the Gate, receiuing innumerable blowes, not knowing by whom they were giuen: making him ſet his hands and knées vnto the ground: neyther his ſhield nor terrible Axe auailed, not ſéeing his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary.</p>
               <p>This ſo tormented our ſeconde <hi>Mars,</hi> that he beganne with all his ſtrength to ſtrike on either ſide, ſtill kéeping his way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde along a fayre Gallery, and béeing neare to the end thereof, the blowes ceaſt, at the opening of the wall whence came foorth a wilde Sauadge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:116"/>In either hand he did leade a <hi>Centaure,</hi> bounde with a Chaine, bearing in their hands long Cemitors.</p>
               <p>The haughtie Warrior not fearing them, with his ſhielde about his arme, and raiſing his Axe with the other, went towards them. At firſt the Sauadge met him with an iron bat, leauing the <hi>Centaures</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him: and at the Princes Helme, he let driue a terrible blowe. <hi>Claramant</hi> lifted his ſhield to take it thereon, the which was driuen with ſuch fury to his head, that he could ſcarce keepe himſelfe from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. With admired ſpéede the <hi>Centaures</hi> aymed theyr Semitors at him: And then he brauely turned his Axe, ſtriking one vpon his breſt, felling him in a ſound, and with a counterbuffe he cut away the others arme with his Semitor.</p>
               <p>Vnrepaid could not <hi>Bryanas</hi> ſonne ſcape, for the Sauadge ſéeing his <hi>Centaures</hi> ſo intreated, diſcharged his bat vpon his ſhoulder, with ſuch monſtrous ſtrength, that maugre his vallour, it ſtrooke him down, falling vpon the aſtoniſhed <hi>Centaure,</hi> that then would riſe, who ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo neare, did caſt his ſtrong armes about, cruſhing him ſo hard that he could not ſtirre, giuing the Sauadge occaſion againe to raiſe his bat, diſcharging it directly vpon the Princes head.</p>
               <p>But he ſéeing it deſcend, with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength, on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den got from betwéene them, ſome halfe yarde away, and ſo auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Batte, ſtriking the <hi>Centaure</hi> ſo venturous a blowe on the breaſt, that he opened the Portall of his heart, with hideous hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to vent forth his liuing breath.</p>
               <p>Incomparable was <hi>Claramants</hi> content of this great good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, yet was it not ſufficient to expell his wonderfull excéeding rage, which made him as nimble and ſwift as a Roe, get on his legges, euen when the Sauadge ſéeing the ill hap of his ſtroke, did diſcharge another.</p>
               <p>Lightly did <hi>Claramant</hi> ſhunne it, and ſo the Batte finding no reſiſtance, ranne one halfe of it into the grounde, and before he could fetche it out againe, the Prince with a downeright blowe eaſily cut aſunder both his armes, and turning againe vppon the <hi>Centaure,</hi> with another mightie blowe, he claue him from the head to the breſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo leauing him dead, and the wilde Monſter roaring with paine, he would haue paſſed to enter the breach the beaſts had made in
<pb facs="tcp:13978:116"/>
the wall, but he ſaw it cloſe, not knowing by what meanes, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the cauſe, with raging furie, returned on the Sauadge, &amp; with his axe wounded him in the middle, parting his brutiſh body in two: at the inſtant the wall opened, whereat thanking his Gods, hee went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the doore, fearing his ſtay might yéelde ſome aduantage to his companions, the which he would not acknowledge <hi>Mars</hi> to haue ouer him.</p>
               <p>No leſſe ſtrong then venturous, was <hi>Don Celindos</hi> Combat, for when he ſaw the Gyants diſgrace, hee valiantly put himſelfe through a Caue, and being at the end thereof, comming to a great gate, he did tread in a hole, falling: yet happily as it fell out. For before the gate, there was a Vault, couered with a boorde made leſſe then the mouth thereof, and faſtened to a round pole, whoſe endes croſſed the hole at one ſide, and ſo treading harde on the boorde, it ouerweighed the one ſide downewards, whereby he fell in: but the holes mouth béeing narrowe, and his ſword hanging by his ſide, in the fall it croſt vpon the hole, and ſo he hung thereat, ouer knées in water.</p>
               <p>This vnthought miſchance, daunted <hi>Meridians</hi> ſonne, yet recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending himſelfe vnto his Gods, he lifted vp his armes, and rayſing his body, caſt it flat ouer the boorde, and as light as he could, with much adoo, he got out of the helliſh place, thinking himſelfe now to haue new riſen from death. He had ſcarce gone thence, when he heard the voyces of certaine men, and liſtening, he heard them ſay: Come, come, let vs goe apace, and wee ſhall ſée how well the Rat canne ſwim.</p>
               <p>A while ſtood the youth ſtill deſirous of reuenge. It was not long deferred him: for through the ſame gate that opened into a garden, there iſſued ſixe ſwaines, euery one with his Bill in his hand. More deſtruction makes not the hungrie woolf among the tender lambs, then <hi>Floralizas</hi> brother of thoſe villaines, ſaying. Sée here you villaines, the Rat ſcaped from your trappe, defend your ſelues from him. By this he had already cleft one to the waſte, and ran an other through the body and heart. Amazed were they to ſée that the knight had ſcaped thir trap, and ſo truſting to their aduantage, they made him ſometime kiſſe the ground with his hands, and then with his head: yet all did but increaſe his rage: For <hi>Alycandros</hi> Nephew being abaſhed to let them hold out ſo long, ſo ſwoong his ſword among them, that hée felde one

dead, an other with ſhoulder cut: an other without legges: and the laſt, armeleſſe, and all wanting their ſoules, hee ſent them poſte vnto hell: finiſhing with theyr liues, the ende of the enterance of the ſecond Caſtle, and ſtaying no longer there, he entered into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>Now is the time (admired Ladies, Goddeſſes of thoſe ſoules that adore you) to lend me a little pittie, (the ornament of your ſexe) equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your magnificent bountie, with your rare and diuine bewties, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the ſunnie rayes of your ſwéete fauours, ſo to ſtrengthen my harſh quill, (although immeritable) that I may expreſſe the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt battell that euer <hi>Mortalles</hi> heard of, worthy to bee atchieued by none but the mightie <hi>Alphebo,</hi> deſeruer of the worlds greateſt Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies.</p>
               <p>Who hauing put on the beſt and richeſt Armour in the Vniuerſe, tooke his ſhéeld about his Arme, and with his vnſheathed ſword, put himſelfe through the gate in the yarde, ſtaying in a roome darker then <hi>Erebus,</hi> and from the doore thereof, iſſued ſulphire flames of fyre, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it reſemble hell it ſelfe: and looking within the doore, he ſaw a great Hall, all of a fyre: wherein there was a huge Sallamander, as big as any horſe.</p>
               <p>She had a great head, faſhioned like an Eagle, with a ſtéele Bill, with clawes of the ſame mettall, of exceſſiue length. Moreouer ſhe had a long tayle like a Serpents, and did nothing but voyd volleys of fyre through her mouth.</p>
               <p>Much amazed was the Emperour at the ſtraunge faſhion of the beaſt, eſpecially, not knowing how to make his battell: for if he enters the roome, ſo great is the fyre, that it is like to conſume him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made a noiſe, to try if ſhe would come forth, and ſo he ſtrooke his ſword againſt the gate, at which noiſe ſhe aroſe, but would not moue: and being vp, looked at the doore, yet ſturred not, and did caſt more fyre from her mouth, then a ſmithes double bellowes rayſeth with blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Many times was <hi>Alphebo</hi> about to follow after her, but iudging it ouerhardie boldneſſe, hee would detaine himſelfe: yet calling to mind his companions might out go him, he thought the danger too ſmall. So drew he forth his dagger, and ſtepping to the doore, hee threw it at
<pb facs="tcp:13978:117"/>
the Sallamander, and the marke being ſo great, and aymed by ſuch an arme, he miſſed her not, but thorow her ribbes he made it flye vp to the hylts, launching out her gorie blood. The wound did not harme her, for licking it with her tongue, it healed, but yet it put her into ſuch paine, that any other but the Emperor would haue bene affrighted, hearing her hideous howling, and hauing an eye at the cauſer of his extreame paine, with two iumps ſhee was with him. Backe ſtepped the Gréeke, thinking ſhee woulde haue followed out, but hee reſted amazed, ſéeing ſhee did not, but kept ſtill within, roring like a Bull.</p>
               <p>Well did the Trebizonian Lord note it, and therefore taking his ſhéeld about his arme, and commending himſelfe to his God, with his ſword he marched againſt the beaſt, and offering to ſtrike her, ſhe bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watchfull, turned about her ſcaly tayle, wherewith ſhe made him looſe his blowe, and recoyle thrée ſteps backe. But being angred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he returned with more aduice then in the beginning, and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his body at her tayle that came again in the ſame maner, he thruſt a poynt at her breſt, running his ſword a handfull into it. Shee ſhryked moſt horribly féeling the wound, and in the inſtant did ſpit ſo much fire, that ſome ouertaking him and getting into his Helme, it ſo heated him, as he thought his face to be a meere cole.</p>
               <p>Two ſteppes did <hi>Alphebo</hi> goe backe to auoyde the fire, whence hee ſawe that the beaſt touching the wound with his tongue, it preſently healed, and ſhee inſtantly ſet her ſelfe at the very edge of the doore.</p>
               <p>It greatly confounded the Emperours ſences, to ſée he could not deuiſe how to vanquiſh her, and imagining her vertue conſiſted in licking her wounds, he determined to ſtrike her on the head where her tongue might not reach it: wherfore couering himſelfe with his ſhéeld, he went to her that expected him at the doore. He offered to ſtrike her on the breſt with a point, which the Sallamander fearing, ſhrunke her body backe, omitting the vſe of her tayle. So the Gréek <hi>Mars</hi> ſtepped forward with his hinmoſt leg, letting his ſword fly at her head. He thoght it wold not leſſe then cleaue her, yet found he ſuch reſiſtance, that glauncing downe it wounded her a little on the necke, which ſhe ſtraight curing with her tongue, it nothing hurt her at all.</p>
               <p>This madded the ſonne of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> eſpecially to ſée how little it
<pb facs="tcp:13978:118"/>
auailed him to wound her: ſo vnreſolued what to doo, hee concluded to receiue a blowe, and then follow her, to execute an other at his pleaſure on her head, hoping her cure wold not be ſo certaine there. Thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined once againe, he went to the doore, where ſhe carefully awaigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, and ſéeing him ſo neare, ere he could ſtrike her, ſhe caſt her clawes vpon him, and gryping him hard with them, ſhe not onely fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated his blowe, but plucked him ſo ſtrongly, that the good Emperour could not ſo ſoone get from her, whereby of force, he was conſtrained to enter in, where ſcarce ſhée had him, but ſhe grapled him about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middle with her ſtéeled tallents, that had he not then had on the beſt Armour in the Vniuerſe, without doubt hee had there periſhed. But though he had eſcaped her ſharpe clawes, yet hee could not auoyde the cruell burning heate of the enchaunted fyre that then incompaſſed him on all ſides, chiefly that which iſſued from the <hi>Sallamanders</hi> mouth.</p>
               <p>It excéedingly tormented the Gréeke, ſéeing himſelfe ſo burne without remedie, and his Armour to glowe like a bright cole of fyre. And ſo with that furie, (hauing his death before his eyes) nimbler then a cat, leaping out of a fyre, he tooke holde of the Sallamanders bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſtraining his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth beyond his power, féeling his fleſh broyle, hee ouerturned her to the ground, and ſtill maintaining his fierceneſſe, he brought her to the doore, and although ſhe there ſtriued moſt to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, yet hee hurled her out of the burning lodging, where on the ſudden ſhee dyed, euen as the fiſh wanting the water that nouriſheth it.</p>
               <p>With his dagger he went to wound her, but ſéeing ſhe ſtyrred not, he went and found her dead, wherfore he gaue his Creator due thanks for ſo great a victorie: and without more ſtay, hee diſarmed himſelfe, for all his Armour was of a very fyre. Hauing done, hee felt himſelfe ſo wearie and tyred, as euer before at any time hee hadde beene: and ſitting downe vpon the Sallamander, he tarried the cooling of his armes.</p>
               <p>While this cruell combat laſted, the haughtie Pagan, both Louer and ſubiect of the gallant <hi>Floraliza,</hi> had not béene idle, who abaſhed at his long ſtaying in winning the paſſage of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Caſtle, went along through the hall, where he did find the Fantaſmo, whoſe ende brought him into a fayre gréene plot, in middeſt
<pb facs="tcp:13978:118"/>
whereof there was a Tower, circled about with a high ſtéepie wall, which had no gate nor ſigne of entrance.</p>
               <p>Amazed at this ſight, the ſtout Schythian looked to the top of the Tower, where he ſaw a well accompliſhed Knight, clad all in rich Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, who with an angrie voice ſaid. What thinkeſt thou knight? it is in vaine to ſéeke an entrance hither, for there is none: vnleſſe thou wilt créepe vp the wal, which is impoſſible, and were it to be done, ſeeſt thou not I am here to forbid it? but were it not ſo dangerous, it is graunted to none, nor none ſhall aſcend hither. In termes of anſwere would not the vntaymed youth procraſtinate the time, but rather with greateſt haſte diſarmed himſelfe, kéeping onely his Helme on his head, and his ſhéeld the which he caſt at his backe, and his ſword hanging by his ſide, hee drew forth his dagger (and beeing deſirous to make his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour knowne vnto the Knight) hee ſtrooke it into the wall, and with both his hands plucking out ſome ſtones, hee clamored vp, and as he aſcended, ſo hee ſtucke his dagger, for thereon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee ſette his féete, whileſt hee made his hands ſure to mount.</p>
               <p>Amazed was the knight, to ſée with what nimbleneſſe and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he did it, but fearing to be aſſaulted on high, he flung down a great ſtone from the top. It fell vpon <hi>Brauorants</hi> Helme, which with a ſore fall, halfe ſenceleſſe it tumbled him to the earth. Neuertheleſſe, within a while hee recouered himſelfe, being fiercer then any Lyon, an reuiling himſelfe and his Gods, which others adored, he returned to proſecute his way: but with great care and watch to eſcape from an other fall, if the Knight played as he did before. Who much delighted to ſée with what courage <hi>Campeons</hi> Nephewe clymed vppe.</p>
               <p>Hee ſo occupied himſelfe in gazing on him, that <hi>Brauorant</hi> had leaue to aſcend ſo high, that when he would haue hurled an other, hee had no time to do it, for while he fetched it, which was ſome two yards from that place, the Pagan had got to the toppe, which being loath to looſe, he brauely leaped in. His ſterne preſence ſomewhat feared the knight, but ſéeing him diſarmed, he recouered ſtrength: yet it auaileth him litle: for <hi>Brauorant</hi> ſo charged him with a blow, that it cut his ſhéeld cleane in two, and deſcending on his Helme, made him ſet his knées to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:119"/>It angred the Knight to bee ſo vſed, who ſtepping in with one foote, did let flie at him a ſtrong poynt. By wreſting aſide his body, <hi>Mars</hi> his Competitor did ſhun it, and ſo ſuddenly cloſed with him, that ſtanding but on one leg, he feld him on his backe, euen when the knight drew forth his dagger, the which the Pagan being vnable to preuent, was enforced to let him go, who got vp, and more irefull then a Bazeliſke, going nearer, gaue him ſuch a blowe on the helme, yet not able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, there it glaunced downe, wounding him a little on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Now was the furious Pagan mad to ſée his aduerſaries blade réeke with his lukewarme blood: whereat detracting no more time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping an other thruſt, againe he cloſed with him, and preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the middle hoyſting him aloft, hee inſtantly tumbled him headlong downe the Tower: where on the ground, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame waight of his Armour, hee was broken in many péeces, and at the inſtant, the Tower vaniſhed away with ſuch a noyſe, as if the earth were ouerwhelmed: ſo that <hi>Brauorant</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſefe beneathe where his Armour lay, and the dead Knight neare vnto him. There he armed himſelfe, getting through a Gate hee had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied.</p>
               <p>No leſſe victorious remained <hi>Archyſiloras</hi> Louer of the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the laſt porche. For hauing ſlaine the infernall beaſts in the Vault, he went in at the opened wall he had deſcried, and croſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a faire Orchard, he came at laſt vnto a big ſtrong Caſtle, ſhut with brazen gates, whereon were made certaine Letters of Emeralds: the which he thus read.</p>
               <q>What knight ſo euer would end the aduenture, let him winde his horne, and the gates ſhall be opened.</q>
               <p>Hee ended, making all the field reſound with the eccho of the Hornes ſhrill ſound: whereat the gates flying open, there iſſued a mightie vgly Draggon, ſhaped almoſt like the Sallamander.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe any other ſaue <hi>Claridiano</hi> would haue feared his aſpect: but hee that was borne to fight, as if he were a weake knight, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Shéeld about his arme, went towards him with his ſword drawne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:119"/>He warded a huge ſtroke with his ſcaly Taile: it ſtrooke his ſhielde from his arme, and had almoſt felde him. It inraged <hi>Claridiano</hi> who ſtifly ſetling himſelfe on his féete, thruſt a poynt at the helliſh beaſt, it had like to haue coſt him his life, for the Dragon eſcaping it, as hée paſt, did ſtrike him ſo terrible a ſtroke, backwardes vppon his gorget, that he was felde on his face.</p>
               <p>Then would the fierce Dragon haue cloſed with him, but hée found <hi>Claridiano</hi> nothing remiſſe, who raging mad, with a quicke leape atoſide, auoyded his fury, and turning vppon him, with his good ſword he cut away his legges by the knées. With dreadfull crying ſhrikes, the woundes beaſt draling his bodie on the grounde, would haue taken the Prince betwéene his pawes, but being wrathfull, and this his laſt battle, with a downeright blowe hée cleft a péece of his head, and with a fierce thruſt, cut his heart cleane in two, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him dead at his féete, and ſo paſt on, deſirous to ende the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture.</p>
               <p>At one inſtant finiſhed <hi>Claridiano</hi> and <hi>Claramant</hi> theyr Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, although <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonnes was ſomewhat longer, becauſe it was more troubleſom. For hauing ſlain the ſauadge &amp; the <hi>Centaures,</hi> hée paced that way they came, til he iſſued into a delightfull Plaine, where he was incountred by a gallant knight in hoſe and doublet, who ſaid. So feared are <hi>Theſeus</hi> Armes (Syr knight) in this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that dreading the loſſe of the Caſtle, I am inioyned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat in this maner, and if you intend to paſſe on, you muſt doo the like: and therefore preſently vnarme you.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke not refuſing it, did ſtraight put off his Armour: to whome the knight deliuered a Rapier and Dagger, with theſe words. (With theſe weapons muſt you defend your ſelfe, valiant knight). I am content, replied <hi>Claramant,</hi> and taking them, prepared for the fight.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke firſt ſetling himſelfe, did with his Dagger ſtrike away his aduerſaries point, and with his Rapier wounded him with a thruſt on the breaſt, and drawing back his leg, controwled the others Rapier, that came directly to his head. The wound much gréeuing the knight, made him reſpect no tricks of Art, but ranne againſt the prince, who fearing his vnaduiſed deſperate comming, croſt his rapier againſt the other, and ſo ſtaied his fury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:120"/>but he burning with ire to be ſo preuented, thought to haue ſlaine him with his Dagger, imagining <hi>Claramants</hi> care was onely in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the rapyer, but it was not ſo: for he ſtretching out his arme further, did firſt ſtabbe his dagger into the knights ſhoulder, which made him forgoe his purpoſe: wherevpon the Prince hauing oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to drawe backe his ſword, did it, and ſuddenly with a ſtrong poynt wounded the knight mortally in the flancke, which altogither made him faint.</p>
               <p>The wounded knight ſéeing his date of life expyred, diſpairing of remedie, he hurled his dagger at him, with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength, that he miraculouſly ſcaped an vntimely death: for <hi>Claramant</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to take it on his hilts, the poynt thereof was ſtayed at the Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, and had it not there found that reſiſtance, it could not but haue run it vp to the hils into his body.</p>
               <p>Amazed was the Gréeke Prince, iudging that, the moment of his byrth, but going to take his reuenge of the knight, hee ſaw him ſplitted on his owne rapyer: for ſéeing himſelfe deadly wounded, and that hee could not eſcape with life, choſe rather to bee his owne execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, then the Prince ſhould tryumphe ouer his death at his hands. Ioying at the victorie of ſo daungerous a Combat, hee proſecuted his way.</p>
               <p>No aduantage had <hi>Claramant</hi> ouer <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> who ended his fight as ſoone as he: for hauing ſlaine the ſwaynes, and paſſed the Garden, hee came vnto a greene Meade, where a knight gallantly mounted, expected the battle: not farre from him there ſtood a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, whereto a luftie courſer was tyed, the which <hi>Alicandros</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew imagining to be for him, he did quickly back, and taking a ſtrong knottie Launce that he alſo there found, eyther parted from the other, to take his carreire, and valiantly made their ſtrong encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>In middeſt of the ſhéelde did <hi>Don Celindo</hi> hit the Knight, and clearely piercing it, thruſt him ſo ſtrongly, that breaking his ſaddle gyrtes, he tumbled him from his horſe. The knight ſtrooke <hi>Don Celin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> on his Beauer, which ſo aſtoniſhed him, that he let goe his horſe bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, who féeling his head at libertie, eleuated himſelfe ſo high, that both fell downe, yet <hi>Don Celindo</hi> perceiuing it, before the fall, did quickly leape from his backe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:120"/>With ſhields about their armes and ſwords on high, the two braue warriors met. With a furious thruſt did <hi>Don Celindo</hi> firſt wound his aduerſary, which made him giue backe thrée ſteppes. But he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned, and gaue him ſuch a blow on the helme, that he thoght himſelfe in heauen, ſo many ſtarres he ſawe about his head, and with a counterbuffe on the ſhoulder, he had almoſt felde him. Like a raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lyon became <hi>Floralindas</hi> ſonne, and offering to ſtrike him on the head, the knight repaired thither with his ſhield. It was the cauſe of his ouerthrow: for <hi>Don Celindo</hi> not minding it, with a point woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him mortally on the breſt, pearcing all his Armor, and then with mightie ſtrength turning his ſword to the others head, he cut away halfe his helme, with a péece of his ſcull. Howling and ſhriking with the wound, the knight turned his backe, and fled through a faire Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</p>
               <p>After him went <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> ouertaking him in a great plaine, where he ſawe foure great Arches inchaſte with precious ſtones, held vp with eight mightie Chriſtal Pillers. There did <hi>Don Celindo</hi> aſſaile the knight, euen when a bewteous Lady moſt richly attyred confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. He was aſtoniſhed at her ſight, thinking he ſawe his deare <hi>Roſiluera.</hi>

               <p>Stay your hand braue knight (ſaid the Lady) and doo not execute your wrath on him that yéelds you the victorie. I cannot (moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princeſſe replied he, amazed to ſée her there) but ſatiſfie your content, obeying what ere you ſhall impoſe on me: as he only borne to do your ſeruice: yet is my poore ſoule tormented with griefe, that this commaund is no greater. It is too much (anſwered ſhe) for her that hath ſhowne you no kindneſſe: and ſo the craftie Damzel taking him by the hande, placed him vnder the laſt Arche, leauing him there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted, without iudgement or vnderſtanding, ſauing how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh her wil, who leauing him there ſaid. Here muſt you remaine Syr knight, and defend the entrance gainſt all the world, if all the worlde ſhall come. Be aſſured (Lady) I wil (replied the inchaunted youth) and firſt Ile leaue to breathe, then deſiſt from defending the Arche. Away went the Lady along the Arches, when the furious <hi>Brauorant</hi> came thitherward, hauing put on his Armour. He ſtept backe as one in a traunce, imagining he behelde his <hi>Floraliza,</hi> into that ſhape ſhe had tranſmuted her ſelfe.</p>

               <p>Courteous Knight, this Arche muſt you defend, with the vtmoſt of your vallor. He made anſwer. Leaue that care to me, for wil at leaſt ſhall not want, if ſtrength forſakes me not.

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. How the Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> ended the famous Inchauntment of <hi>Roſelia,</hi> and what elſe happened.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great was the care that thoſe wiſe men, <hi>Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo, Artemidoro</hi> and <hi>Nabato</hi> had ouer the Gréekes and theyr Empire, that by theyr Arte had reached to the knowledge, how that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Monarchy would be brought to the point of an vtter ouerthrow, and perpetuall deſolation: wherefore ſo entierly affecting her Princes, (as this great Hiſtorie hath amply mentioned) for their Loues, they reuolued their bookes, to know the cauſe, and cauſer of ſuch bloodie warres: which they found to be the two Princeſſes, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> and <hi>Roſelia</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereupon they reſolued to Inchaunt them, beginning firſt with <hi>Lyriana,</hi> within the ſea Tower, as hath bene related.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:121"/>And ſéeing that the Romane Princeſſe was left, they ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues togither, in the making of this Inchantment the ſtrongeſt euer ſéene, for while ſhe was ſo kept, her Father ſhould not knowe what had happened betwéene her and <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> nor ſhould ſhe at his hands require reuenge againſt him. As they did determine it, ſo did the wiſe Magitians performe it, making it far ſtronger then <hi>Lyria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> for they intended to kéepe her long time there, vntil ſome good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were taken about the Gréekes affaires.</p>
               <p>Againe, they reſolued to haue <hi>Lyriana</hi> diſinchaunted, and her Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls with the <hi>Brytaine</hi> Prince ſolemnized, hoping it wold be a means to reconcile the Souldan of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> giuing him ſo great a Prince as <hi>Roſabel</hi> to be his ſonne in lawe. They would not do ſo by <hi>Roſelia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe could not be wedded with whome ſhe had imprinted in her heart. But the peruerſe <hi>Selagio</hi> (by meanes of <hi>Lupercio</hi>) hunting after reuenge for the death of <hi>Fangomadon</hi> (whom <hi>Roſicler</hi> flew, as in the firſt Chapter of the firſt booke of this third part is expreſt) would néeds procure the libertie of this Lady, with <hi>Arbolinda</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her: for which purpoſe, in a Barke he drew <hi>Brauorant</hi> and <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> from the Fléete: doing the like by <hi>Alphebo,</hi> directing alſo <hi>Claridiano</hi> and <hi>Claramant</hi> thither: where all of them performed ſuch déeds in armes as is ſpecified, and worthie of ſuch great Princes, ſlaying all the kéepers of the Caſtles.</p>
               <p>But the wiſe men fearing the two Ladies libertie, as the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of their hopes, erected theſe foure Arches, there to Inchaunt thoſe mightie Warriors, that none might end the aduenture, they being the ſole Pillers of humane ſtrength. Twentie yeares they purpoſed the Inthauntment ſhould ſtand, finding by theyr Art, that after that time <hi>Greece</hi> would flouriſh with moſt happineſſe, by a contracted League, with the greateſt Potentates of the world. But the ſupreame King of Kings, hauing otherwiſe diſpoſed of thoſe affayres, fruſtrated (as you ſhall ſée) theyr toyles, bringing thither at that time <hi>Alphebo,</hi> ſole <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> in armes, vallor, and all bountie.</p>
               <p>So much the longer he ſtaied, vntil his armor was coole, and then buckling it on, paſt the laſt Portall, comming to the Arches, at the very inſtant the Lady had done inchaunting the knights, and lighting on the Piller, he thus read the inſcription.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:122"/>Let none though he be <hi>Mars</hi> in Armes, pretend to paſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for what is done, is nothing comparable to what is to do, ſeeing he muſt Combat with the Myrrors of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry, <hi>Claramant, Claridiano, Brauorant,</hi> and <hi>Don Celindo.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Trebezonian</hi> Lord did feele his blood fréeze in his bodie, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſtrong Companions were there inchaunted, and among them his ſonne, for whoſe ſake he greatly dreaded the fight, fearing ſome ill miſchaunce either to him or his ſonne: for he déemed none equalled <hi>Claridiano.</hi> Oh, <hi>Claridianas</hi> Lord wiſht his ſonne thence, and in his place the whole world: for that power vnited, he not ſo much did doubt. As he was thus conſidering with himſelfe, he heard a voyce (that by <hi>Selagios</hi> procurement ſaid) What doubts thou Illuſtrious Emperor? Conſider it is not worthie thy great valor to refuſe theſe Combats, for theyr endes ſhal conclude the famouſeſt déeds in armes that was euer heard of.</p>
               <p>Altogither did theſe words put him from his penſiueneſſe, iudging his delaie to procéed from baſe cowardiſe: wherfore as ſwift as a Roe, he went towards the firſt Arche, when he heard the noyſe of certaine voyces, that ſaid. Leaue, leaue, this accurſed enterpriſe, thou mightie <hi>Alphebo,</hi> for with the blowes thou giueſt to one knight, thou woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt <hi>Bryanas</hi> ſoule, and with thoſe thou diſchargeſt on the other, thou doeſt ſplit her heart, to whom thou oweſt all content: thy deare <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidiana</hi> we meane.</p>
               <p>Backe ſtept the Emperor, not in feare of the Battles, for his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke mind was not vſed to it, but to haue vnderſtood thoſe words, yet ſuppoſing they were vttered only to threaten him, rather deſiring to die (oh admirable courage) then to be tainted with cowardiſe, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf to his true God, he began to march towards the firſt arch, being nothing hurt by the Inchantment, for the vertue of his King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it, the which he alwayes woare, wherewith he freed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Lyndarazas</hi> impriſonment, where he atchiued immortall fame. He had no ſooner entred it, but like a blazing Commet, <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> iſſued to entertaine him, (vnknowne to his brother) by reaſon of the inchantment. At that time a gallant window opened, where appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two ladies, whoſe bewties ſtained <hi>Venus</hi> in her pride, there come
<pb facs="tcp:13978:122"/>
to beholde the battels. At length togither met the two haughtie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battants, either receiuing the other, with the puiſſance of their ſtrong terrible blowes. They diſcharged them on the toppe of their heads ſo rigorouſly, that ſquadrons of ſparkles flew from their helmes. Either did ſet one knée on the ground, bowing their heads with ſuch low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, as if they had knowne themſelues to be brothers. Both remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned angrie and fearefull of the others ſtrength: ſo riſing, they gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the hammering of their bodies, as if it were a battell of twentie knights.</p>
               <p>The Emperors new wonne armor, did well defend his fleſh from the cutting of <hi>Theſeus</hi> axe. Neuertheleſſe, within an houre of their fight, he felt his bodie ſorely bruſed, yet he comforted himſelfe, ſéeing his aduerſarie beſmeared with his owne blood, hauing his armor rent and torne in many places, but yet as luſtie as when he beganne, and raiſing his axe, he laide on the others ſhoulder. The inpenetrable armes he may thanke for his life, the which they ſaued, though not him from touching the earth with his hands. And ſo the valiant Prince ſeeing this good occaſion, cloſed with him, that either caſt his ſtrong armes about the other, to procure eithers aduantage. Soone got <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramant</hi> ouer the Emperor, becauſe he aſſaulted him with a ſuddaine aduiſed charge.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Claridianos</hi> Louer hauing recouered his foyle, made him looſe his ground, and ſo ouerturned him of one ſide, that croſſing his legge with his, he tript his brother, who fell vnder him: yet as ſwift as an Eagle he got vp, and grappling togither, they tumbled vp and downe the paued earth.</p>
               <p>Where ſéeing they could not ſo vanquiſh one another, let go, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to their weapons, with ſuch mightineſſe &amp; heauie blowes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their bodies, that none ſaue they in al the world, could ſuffer them: yet did not they faint, nor looſe no whit of their fierce courage, whoſe furie being throughly heated, ſéemed to increaſe their ſtrength and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinent, becomming ſo nimble and quicke in aſſaulting and retiring, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and defending, that their féete ſéemed to be winged. Greatly did <hi>Alphebo</hi> wonder at his aduerſaries fierceneſſe, iudging him one of the beſt in the vniuerſe, calling to remembrance the battell he had in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with his brother <hi>Roſicler,</hi> about the Princeſſe <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabrides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:123"/>He could not deuiſe how to get from him that arch, ſuppoſing his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie conſiſted thereon. Committing himſelfe to God, and truſting to his forces, auoyding a thruſt, he cloſed with <hi>Claramant,</hi> and before he could preuent it, he hoyſed him from the ground, who vnable to forbid it, he carried out of the arch, but with excéeding labour, for <hi>Claramant</hi> with the vtmoſt of his power ſtriued to let it. He was no ſooner thence, when as one dead he remained in the Emperors armes, who laying him downe, imagining hee would reuiue with the ende of the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he paſt that, till he entred the ſecond arch, where againſt him, came the Mirror of courteſie &amp; fortitude, the magnanimious <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> Almoſt did his father knowe him, by the maieſticke gate &amp; come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe wherewith he made againſt him, giuing him ſo ſuddain a blow, that ere he repaired to the defence, hee ſeconded two thruſts, which ſorely vexed <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne, making him ſtagger thrée ſteppes back, and before he recouered himſelfe, he gaue him a downe right blow on the helme, which made him ſée many millions of firie ſparkes. It great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inraged the péereleſſe <hi>Alphebo,</hi> who ſéeing himſelfe ſo handled, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that he was his father, and he his ſonne, did moſt terribly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his rich blade vpon his ſhield.</p>
               <p>It yéelds no defence againſt the beſt arme in the world, for in two péeces it was throwne to the ground, and deſcending to the helme, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there more reſiſtance, it made his head bend with an awfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gey due to his authoritie, and kiſſe the earth with his hands, and as he roſe, with a ſtrong poynt he was ouerturned to the ground. Long was he not ſo, but riſing like the winde, blinde with rage, he tooke his ſword in both hands, diſcharging it on his fathers ſhield, the which reſiſted the edge, was ſtrooke with ſuch might againſt his helme, that he thought the firmament was within. With his knées on the ground he ſo remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſtoniſhed, till the ſound of another blowe vpon his ſhoulder awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened him, to ſtay himſelfe with his hands from falling.</p>
               <p>Neuer did <hi>Alphebo</hi> féele himſelfe more chollericke, nor furious, nor neuer by one battle ſo indaungered: but fearing to be ouercome, with madding rage he went againſt him he tendred as his ſoule, and on his waſte gaue him a moſt mightie blow.</p>
               <p>It made him incline his bodie that way, for cutting his armor, it wounded him alittle, ſprinkling the ground with his crimſon blood. With a counterbuffe the Emperor returned, hitting him on his Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13978:123"/>
vpwards bounded the ſword, &amp; falling on the buckles of his helm, it cut them all, making it flie from his head. With admiration did the <hi>Trebizonian</hi> Lord gaze on his picture, in ſuch careleſſe manner, that <hi>Claridiano</hi> had time to ſtrike him at his pleaſure on the middeſt of his precious helme, and ſtraining the vtmoſt of his ſtrength, he felled him downe, making the blood guſh from the cloſings of his helme. With more eagerneſſe doth not the ſoring hawk ſeizeon his pray, then <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi> cloſed with his father, and caſting his armes about him, thought to choke him betwéene them, at ſuch time as the fierce Emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Oh, then did hee wiſh to haue any other then <hi>Claridiano</hi> betwéene his armes, (I, though it were the God of battels himſelfe) to inflict on him the deſerued puniſhment for ſuch vſance, the which hee could not now do, vnleſſe he ſhould powre vengeance on himſelfe. But hauing good hold on him, with ſome trouble at length hee lifted him from the ground, and with violent ſtriuing, oppoſing his greateſt forces againſt his ſonnes reſiſtance, with blood guſhing from his face, he carried him out of the arch: and leauing him euen like <hi>Claramant,</hi> hee felt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die neuer wearier in all his life.</p>
               <p>A while hee ſate him downe at the foote of the ſame arch, to reſt himſelfe, and putting off his helme, hee wyped his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die face: but with the ſight of the two Ladies in the window, whom he iudged to bee <hi>Roſelia</hi> and <hi>Arbolinda,</hi> remembring their fréedome, he rebuckled on his helme, and marched to the third arch, where <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorant,</hi> the flower of Pagans ſtrength, incountred him with a ſtrong poynt.</p>
               <p>On his ſhield did the Emperor receiue it, againſt which the ſword bending, forced him two ſteppes backe. Another ſeconded the Pagan on his breaſt, making him bende his bodie backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>And comming vppon him with the third, <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne gaue way vnto the furious poynt, which finding no ſtay, it drewe the hardy Scythian after it. Whom <hi>Alphebo</hi> following, ſtrooke him on the flancke, and vnable to cut his armor, he bruſed his fleſh within. This blowe chafed the fierce Pagan, who like a Baſſeliſke, with <hi>Mars</hi> his ſtrength, did let flie at him a mightie blowe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:124"/>On his ſhield did the Emperor take it, the which was ſtrooke ſo againſt his helme, making it thunder like the ſtormie heauens. And then hée gaue him a cruell thruſt, that had not his armor béene the beſt in the world, he could not but haue incurred mortall perill. The Gréekes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected no trickes of defence being ſo handled: wherefore like winters hayle, he charged the Pagan with his blowes in ſuch ſort, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted amazed at the Emperors fierceneſſe, yet fainted not his ſhewen valor in the beginning, though his owne blood had beſmeared his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, whoſe inchauntment was not of force againſt the cutting of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebos</hi> ſword.</p>
               <p>About this time, the Gréeke with all his puiſſance, gaue him a blow on his helme, whoſe force greatly inforced him back, which occaſioned the Emperor to execute his intent, for noting with what blinde eager furie the Scythian came againſt him, the pollitick Lord returned back by little and little, euen to the firſt Arch. So <hi>Brauorant</hi> thinking hée did it for feare, haſtily followed him, and beeing almoſt out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he heard a voyce that ſaid: Returne, returne, renowned <hi>Brauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and remember <hi>Floralizas</hi> command: go not out of the firſt arch, for if thou doeſt, thou art but dead. Great was his affection towardes that Ladie, hearing himſelfe called by her owne name, amazedly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his head, ſuppoſing ſhe was there. Which happie occaſion <hi>Brya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> ſonne would not looſe, for watching ſuch opportunitie, with one ſtride he ioyned with him, hoyſting his bodie in the ayre, and béeing neare out of it, maugre the Pagans ſtrength, he threw him foorth, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him as one dead.</p>
               <p>Infinit thankes did the Gréeke render vnto God for this victorie, and without longer ſtay, he paced to the laſt arch, kept by <hi>Alicandros</hi> Nephew, with whom hee had one of the braueſt battels in the world: for the aduantage the Emperour had ouer him in ſtrength, the other ſupplied by being freſh, and he wearie and tired. It ſo pleaſed the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Roſelia</hi> (being one of thoſe that looked on them) to ſée with what dexteritie and valor <hi>Don Celindo</hi> proſecuted his fight, that ſhee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (though ſhee was inchanted) to make none Patrone of her heart but him, if ſhe wedded not <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> Here doth not <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> particularize this combat, becauſe he would not be tedious, onely hée affirmeth it was one of the famouſeſt that euer was: and how in the and he was as his companions carried out of the arches, but with a
<pb facs="tcp:13978:124"/>
new wound, for while he made his battell, he chanced to behold <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> whom he ſo well liked, that hee almoſt forgot the faire <hi>Roſiluera</hi> Excéeding great ioy conceiued the Gréeke <hi>Mars,</hi> to haue wonne the Arches, and as he returned throgh them, a Ladie incountred him with theſe words.</p>
               <p>Know, illuſtrous Emperor, mirrour of the worlds chiualrie, that the end of this aduenture conſiſts in giuing me that ring on your finger, to put it on your wife <hi>Claridianas</hi> that yonder lieth, and it behooues you to do it with ſpeede, for elſe her life is ſhort, and readie to exſpire her cancelled date, by the hands of that knight which ſtands ouer her. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place whence the Damzell came, he turned his head, where he thought he ſaw his <hi>Claridiana</hi> lying on the ground, and ouer her a knight with a dagger in his hand, wherewith he offered to ſtabbe her. No longer ſtayed the haughtie Gréeke, but like a furious Lyon, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Ladie he ranne to the knight, who fearing to be ſlaine, (being <hi>Nabato</hi> ſo diſguiſed) togither with the damzell vaniſhed away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Emperour wondred, as alſo of the ſtraunge aduenture of the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>In the end of the arches, he found a large wide paire of ſtaires, made all of precious ſtones, hee aſcended them quicker then a hurried bullet from a cannons mouth, and beeing at the toppe, hee ſawe a faire rich Gallerie, from whence the Ladies viewed the battels. At the ende thereof, he paſt a gorgeous Portall, that opened into a great Hall of admired riches: and as he would enter into it, two Ladies ſaluted him, whom he thoght to be thoſe before mentioned, being indéed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Roſelia,</hi> and <hi>Arbolinda.</hi> With much courteſie the Emperour returned their ſalutations, and to bee aſſured if they were whom the Tables mentioned, he demanded of them thus. Let me intreate you faire Ladies, to tell mee where within this dwelling I may finde the Princeſſe <hi>Roſelia</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arbolinda</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for I much deſire to ſée them, to know whether it bee true, what the world repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of their beauties?

Demaund what you will (replied the kinde warriour) for I will performe what euer it be.</p>
               <p>We hoped no leſſe from your valour (ſaid <hi>Arbolinda</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray you giue vs that ring on your finger, that we may carrie

it to <hi>Roſelia,</hi> that greatly néeds it. I am content (anſwered the wary (Gréeke) but firſt go we beyond yon firſt Arch, &amp; there I proteſt by the faith of a knight, to performe my promiſe. That is to denie it (ſaide <hi>Roſelia</hi>) for wee may not go any farther. Why then ſoueraigne Ladies (replied <hi>Alphebo</hi>) I recall my promiſe, intended on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

               <p>You will not I hope, intreat vs with ſuch violence, for it is not the part of a good knight, to oppreſſe diſtreſſed Ladies, inforcing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils: which to preuent, wee will leaue you, returning to <hi>Roſelia,</hi> that expects vs. As the gallant Ladies were turning their backes, <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne ſtept to them, and tooke them in his armes, and in his going out of the Gallerie, many hideous fearefull ſhrikes were heard, and he charged with mightie inuincible blowes, ynough to haue diſſolued <hi>Vulcans</hi> work houſe: yet for all this, did not the flower of armes ceaſe to go forward, ſometimes ſetting his hands, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his knées to the ground, and then inclining his head belowe his breaſt.</p>
               <p>Many terrible illuſions were oppoſed againſt him, ſufficient to daunt <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe. But they nothing feared him, for the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious <hi>Alphebo,</hi> by this had deſcended the ſtaires, and although tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with oppreſſiue vlowes, confronted with horred appariſians, and his hearing made deafe wfth miſerable howlings, yet hee got out of all the arches, at what inſtant there ſounded the lowdeſt and moſt ſhrilleſt noyſe, with the mightieſt thunderclap that euer was heard in the world. Tenne myles from <hi>Rome</hi> it was heard, making that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cittie ſhake as with an earthquake, vtterly diſſoluing the beſt inchauntment that euer mortals heard of.</p>
               <p>In middeſt of an oderiferous plaine, did <hi>Alphebo</hi> find himſelfe, clad
<pb facs="tcp:13978:125"/>
in his rich won armor, with his ſon <hi>Claridiano,</hi> that equalled him in all things: with them the mightie <hi>Claramant,</hi> in all reſpects comparable, to brother and Couſin.</p>
               <p>There alſo was that furious <hi>Brauorant,</hi> Paragon of the Gyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tean regions, accompanied with the new Louer <hi>Don Celindo:</hi> and with them, the beauteous Princeſſes, <hi>Roſelia</hi> and <hi>Arbolinda.</hi> Well remembred <hi>Brauotant</hi> what had him befallen, and thinking he had by him béene vanquiſhed, would haue challenged the Emperor of <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zound</hi> about it, but that he deſcried a great company comming throgh the Forreſt: and ſuppoſing it to be the Emperour of Rome, hee tooke his leaue of the Princes and Ladies, who were not able to ſtay him. And comming to the ſea ſide, he ſhipped himſelfe in his Barke, which in ſhort time brought him to the Souldan of <hi>Nyqueas</hi> Fléete. <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi> and <hi>Claramant</hi> would alſo néeds depart, imagining they were not knowne, ſhaping their courſe towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> becauſe they heard the world prepared againſt her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alphebo</hi> would not hinder their voyage, ſéeing it pleaſed them to conceale their names, and ſo he tooke his leaue of them. By this arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom the noyſe of their battels, and the beaſts howlings had brought thither: and alighting from his <hi>Alfana,</hi> he embraced his daughter <hi>Roſelia,</hi> and <hi>Arbolinda,</hi> with ſuch ioy as may be thought. In the end (to be ſhort) <hi>Don Celindo</hi> recounted what had befallen, which made them all wonder, admiring <hi>Alphebos</hi> valours: who alſo vnwilling to be longer detained, tooke his leaue and departed. So ſhipping himſelfe, arriued in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he at large diſcourſed the whole proceſſe of the aduenture. <hi>Don Celindo</hi> remained mith <hi>Roſelia,</hi> whoſe diſinchantment was ſolemnized with many triumphes. Thus leauing them all, we returne to the valiant Princes, <hi>Claramant,</hi> and <hi>Claridiano,</hi> nauigating by ſea in their inchaunted Barke.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. How the two Princes, <hi>Claridiano</hi> and <hi>Claramant,</hi> arriued at <hi>Grecia,</hi> and of the faire aduenture that befell them with a knight.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith more furie then the dreadful threatning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met renteth his paſſage through the firie element, did the inchanted barke wherein thoſe two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nauigated, furrow the raging billowes of <hi>Neptunes</hi> inhoſpitable regions, directing their courſe towards the memorable Grecian Empire. So ſwiftly did it cut the foming waues, that foure daies after, in ſight of the Gréekes Fléete, that anchored in the Hauen of <hi>Hircambella,</hi> and not farre from it they ranne a ſhore. It not a little gladded them, knowing where they had arriued, for <hi>Claramant</hi> greatly deſired to ſée that Court, ſo famouſed through the world.</p>
               <p>Being on land, they mounted vpon mightie horſes, which <hi>Galte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> had prouided them, with a ſhield for <hi>Trebatios</hi> ſonne, and ſo tooke their iourney toward <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hearing by the way of the proofe of the diſamorous Tower: the diſcourſe whereof, <hi>Claridiano</hi> tolde his vncle, which was the greater motion to ſtirre him to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Whereto his Couſin ſaid. And it comes well to paſſe, that the earth may know, how both by land and ſea, you are <hi>Mars</hi> his fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: but I would not for the world, be there knowne, for being baniſht by my ſwéete enemie from her deare preſence, I ſhould not well obey her commaund, ſo to diſcloſe my ſelfe. Thus treating of this matter, and of <hi>Roſelias</hi> ſtraunge inchauntment, iudging it the haughtieſt euer heard of, <hi>Claramant</hi> began in this manner. It would reioyce my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoule, to know that famous knight, called of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> for as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we were all vanquiſht by him, and the glorie of that great aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſolely attributed to him. Becauſe I imagine you will bee glad to knowe who he is, (replied <hi>Claridiano</hi>) knowe, it is the Emperor of <hi>Trebezound,</hi> whom the heauens decréed to be my father. I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding glad thereof, (ſaid <hi>Claramant</hi>) and ſure I was, ſo valiant a ſonne could not but procéede from ſo glorious a father. But I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb facs="tcp:13978:126"/>
to know who thoſe thrée knights were, that kept the arches of the Tower in the ſea: for beléeue me, they are the flower of Armes. Two of them (replied the Prince) I can tell you of, the one <hi>Bembo</hi> by name, King of <hi>Achaya,</hi> and Lord Generall of the Souldans Fléete: the other is a moſt ſtrong Pagan, King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and mortall enemie to the Gréekes. The laſt, yet ſéeming of a bigger conſtitution of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed members, I knowe not, ſauing that it was he which in our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie proued <hi>Roſilias</hi> inchantment, being he we met in the Forreſt, in battell againſt the Emperor my father: But the time is long, and we may end any particular combat, for I no leſſe deſire it then you, ſince I croſt him on the ſeas, when I defended your ladder. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation they came vnto a cleare riuer of freſh bubbling water, which inuited them to find out his ſpring, to paſſe away the heate of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, for the Sunne hauing progreſt halfe his courſe, had alreadie dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moyſture of the earth. Within a while they found a faire Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, where they allighted, both to waſh their faces, and take ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt as <hi>Polliſandros</hi> prouiſion affoorded. Thus they droue away the time with ſome content, for <hi>Claridiano</hi> for his vncles ſake controwled his greefes, when his Ladies remembrance troubled him. So béeing deſirous to take a nappe, they parted a litle one from the other to ſléep. Short it was, for the Muſicke of a ſwéete voyce awaked them at once. Wherevpon <hi>Claridiano</hi> ſaid. Haue you euer heard (braue Knight) more ſwéet harmonie? Beléeue me, we haue met with ſome good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, for he that ſings, in my opinion, ſhould liue by being in loue. We may not leaue the enioying of ſo ſwéete a note. So they roſe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and putting on their helmes, tooke their ſhields and followed the ſound they heard, and then ceaſed. They came vnto a little groue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with loftie Pynes, there ſaw they a ſhepheard, of the faireſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world: and ſo beautifull, that his ſight wold haue made him enuious that kept <hi>Admetus</hi> flockes. He ſéemed to be very young, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Recorder in his hand, to whoſe ſound tuning his voyce, he ſung his ſoules gréefe vnto thoſe ſenceleſſe trées.</p>
               <p>Credit me, Prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Claramant</hi>) that ſome chance in Loue hath made him ſo diſguiſe himſelfe: for although there be gallant ſhepheards about theſe and other fields, yet this his tender behauiors ſhowes, he hath not béene brought vp to tend ſhéepe.</p>
               <p>Let vs attend him (replied <hi>Claridiano</hi>) for hee himſelfe will reſolue
<pb facs="tcp:13978:127"/>
this our doubt. They néeded not much perſwaſion to make them liſten, for the ſwéetneſſe wherewith he ſounded his Inſtrument, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to mooue, as did the Thracian Poet his melodie, which when he ended, he warbled foorth this Elegie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Great muſt needs be the greef, extreme muſt needs be the torments</l>
                  <l>Which I do feele while I want (faire <hi>Polinarda</hi>) thy ſight:</l>
                  <l>Eſteeming thy ſweet preſence my ſole happines in life,</l>
                  <l>How may thy long abſence but be a death to my heart?</l>
                  <l>On this ſtaie yet I liue, in thy diſgrace that I liue not,</l>
                  <l>For then in endles plagues damned I were to periſh:</l>
                  <l>Rather as one whoſe ſincere Loue was kindly regarded,</l>
                  <l>On the higheſt heau'ns-ſpheare placed I was by thy hand:</l>
                  <l>Golden dayes were thoſe. But now diſpoiled of all bliſſe</l>
                  <l>Like ſad <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> ioyles I wander alone.</l>
                  <l>In darkneſſe I do ſtraie, miſſing thy Sunne to direct me,</l>
                  <l>My day to night turnde is, my delite into laments.</l>
                  <l>Vexed thus though I am: Complaine on thee yet I cannot,</l>
                  <l>Of thee (Ladie diuine) for loue I had loue againe.</l>
                  <l>Spightfull Fortune it is, that of all ioyes hath me bereaued,</l>
                  <l>And with deadly malice croſt me with heauy miſhaps.</l>
                  <l>Diſtreſt by Fortune, yet neuer will I be daunted,</l>
                  <l>Maugre her, and her force, will I loue, and be belou'd:</l>
                  <l>Enuious ill Fortune cannot compell me to diſpaire,</l>
                  <l>When ſhe hath her worſt done, then can <hi>I</hi> be but a wretch.</l>
                  <l>Then when I moſt am a wretch, moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant ſhalbe my hope then,</l>
                  <l>Which without her compaſſe firmly by faith I do keepe:</l>
                  <l>Her force will not I feare, nor ſeeke for her helpe that I lou'd be</l>
                  <l>Oh fayreſt of fayres, on thee alone I depend:</l>
                  <l>In preſence was I lou'd, and ſhalbe I doubt not in abſence</l>
                  <l>(Lady, in whom vertue like to thy bewtie ſhineth,</l>
                  <l>Conſtant as comely). Bur alas, that <hi>I</hi> muſt like a Pilgrime</l>
                  <l>Wander a whole age thus through regions ſo remote,</l>
                  <l>Kingdomes farre diſtant, where <hi>I</hi> wiſh in vaine to behold thee,</l>
                  <l>Where new ſprung dangers hourely delaie my returne</l>
                  <l>From thy ſight baniſhed, whoſe ſiluer rayes be ſo ſplendent</l>
                  <l>That therewith dazled, <hi>Cynthia</hi> hideth her head!</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13978:127"/>Expect yet do <hi>I</hi> ſtill and that day daily do looke for,</l>
                  <l>In thy ſweete preſence once yet againe to reioyce:</l>
                  <l>Conuerting ſadneſſe to gladneſſe, ſorrow to ſinging:</l>
                  <l>Rapte in bliſſe, then <hi>I</hi> ſhall perpetually tryumph.</l>
                  <l>In meane time reſting on this ſo ſacred a comfort,</l>
                  <l>This thy want perforce with patience <hi>I</hi> do beare,</l>
                  <l>Till the raging tempeſt of Fortunes fury be ore-blow'n,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>I</hi> of all turmoyles ſhall haue a happie releaſe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>No more could the two valiant Gréekes vnderſtand, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement grones that burſt from his ſoule, togither with hart-breaking ſighes, drowned the verie ſound of his words. Now that he had thus giuen a litle paſſage to his griefes, by publiſhing them vnto thoſe loftie pynes, that by bowing their ſpreading braunches, ſéemed to pittie his diſtreſſe, with a breathleſſe <hi>(Ay me)</hi> he began his laments in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Oh Loue! how extreamly haſt thou executed the power of thy ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor on me? Oh my tender yeres, eclipſed in the budding of your ſpring, with the nipping winter of ſower griefe: Iniuſtly haſt thou made me an example of the happieſt Louer that euer was, neuer hauing againſt thy ſoueraintie ſo much as in thought offended, nor yet in any thing gainſaid or contradicted thy awfull power. Oh I acknowledge it, and do confeſſe what happineſſe is obtained, ſubmitting true dutie to thy commaund, as to the ſole deitie able to giue life, or ſwéeteſt death: and yet for all thou art long ſince aſſured with what ſubmiſſiue humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I haue obeyed thy beheſts, and with patience endured thy croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo dearely bought, at the higheſt rate and price of my content, it pleaſeth thée, when the ſoueraigne Goddeſſe of my ſoule, would moſt fauour me, to exile me her preſence by ſuch cruell meanes. On me, and my poore heart, that neuer did offend thée, haueſt thou tyrannized with all inhumanitie, winking and pardoning the Conſpirators againſt thy rule.</p>
               <p>What haſt thou got by abſenting me from her ſtampt in my liuing ſoule? wherein wert thou offended, when I beheld her preſence? were it not I feare to be accounted Traytor vnto thy Crowne and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallitie, I would call, and proclaime thée (ouer and beſides that thou art cruell) to be enuious: and if not ſo, that Iealouſie (plague of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and immortals) to ſée me loue and liue thereby, and in recompence of ſo firme a faith, to hope for the glorie of being againe beloued,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:128"/>
hath forced thée to make me in exile wander thus from that her happie preſence.</p>
               <p>I neuer haue ſéene tokens of a perfecter Louer in my life (ſaid <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi>) and as I am a Knight, if it lie in mee to helpe him, I will doo it to the daunger of my life. Of this and more is the Louer worthie of (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his vncle): but I would not haue had you bound your ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo much, wherby you ſhould omit your iourney to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the which would gréeue my very ſoule, eſpecially looſing your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. To doo ſo would increaſe my ſorrow in the higheſt degrée (ſaid the Prince) becauſe our loue bindes vs to gréeue at others abſence: yet will not I remit to procure his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, that know how to loue ſo intier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and it may be, I ſhall this way find ſome meaſure for my torments: knowing that her ſight (Commandreſſe of my ſoule) will but augment my paines, by being in diſgrace: and what great glorie it were to bee imbraced in her grace.</p>
               <p>But go we to him that learned to loue, and not feare the plague of abſence, for neuer yet did any féele it, but iudged it woorſe then death. Let vs go (replied the frée youth) for it is charitie to helpe him in al thinges. Wherevpon they made a little noyſe, that the careleſſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard might heare their going. With ſome alteration he did riſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſome other matter. But when (by Mooneſhine) hee fawe thoſe two knight, the riches of their armour, and ſo gallant diſpoſition, hée went to méete them (beeing no leſſe courteous then any) and ſaide. What is it you this way ſéeke (braue knights?) for although Fortune hath brought me to the laſt poynt, to make me diſpaire of my ſelfe, ſo I may in any thing worke your contents, beléeue mee, I will be glad ſhee ſhould, for that time lengthen my deſpiſed life, then which I could not be more plagued.</p>
               <p>Whereto <hi>Claridiano</hi> made anſwere. Wee come this knight and my ſelfe, to offer our perſons to procure your content (courteous ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard) if your neceſſities requires them, the which we ſhal hazard, with more will then you to imploy them. There is no ſatiſfaction, nor yet gratefulneſſe, ſufficient to ballance your moſt kinde offer (gallant Knights, replied the ſhepheard) but in doing it, you haue made known the valor and magnanimitie of your heroicke minds, whereto by boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie you were bound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:128"/>Oh, may Loue recompence it (if it hath not bene poſſible to denie his ſoueraigntie) with more ioyes then I at his hands haue receiued: but now any comfort whatſoeuer, will but augment my gréefe, the which hath ſo far extended it ſelfe, that no remedy nor ſalue can cure it. Then <hi>Claramant</hi> tooke occaſion thus. But althogh phiſicke doth not alwaies whole cure the inueterated Mallady, yet many oftentimes it preuents, and expelles many dangerous accidents, that would elſe excéedingly aggrauate the infirmitie, and ſo for all it may not now pleaſe you to communicate it to thoſe that will féele your ſorrow, it will be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pittie it, were it but to be anſwered with (take comfort, for others haue bene vſed with like crueltie, and you are not alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in the world).</p>
               <p>It is euen ſo, ſaid the amorous ſhéepheard: for amongſt all the greateſt conſolations inuented to mittigate the paines in loue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, is the cheefeſt: yet in me to diſcouer them, it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the partie I loue. But to tell the torments I haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and what happineſſe they had obtained, and my extreame fall from that high felicitie, were to wrong my ſelfe in the recitall, for it will be but an argument of little ſufferance in me, ſéeing that the leaſt of my ſuffered paines was ſufficient to withſtand a thouſand deathes: But now to conſider they haue let me ſuruiue, oh, there is no euill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to it, nor none can I deuiſe worſe. For had I then bene depriued of my abhorred life, I ſhuld not haue bene ſo familiar with ſower gréefe: yet to ſée that after the looſing of that ſoueraigne good, my life doth ſtill perſecute me with woes, that death fearing to come neare them, flyes from me when I moſt do call him: oh there is no patient that can endure this, nor I haue power to tollerate it, but with millions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall teares, to bewaile this loſſe and my miſfortunes. Farther hée could not proceede, for his teares interrupted him, which ſo mooued the tender hearted Prince, that they intreated him to make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his gréefs, that they might iudge whether he haue reaſon ſo to gréefe.</p>
               <p>Then the ſhéepheard ſaid. I am ſure it is good to relate the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and proceſſe of my woes, vnto ſuch Knights: yet my diſtreſſed ſoule refuſeth to refreſh the memorie with ſo many euilles: but that you may know how ſmall this my languiſhment is, ſit you down, and you ſhall heare the greateſt iniuſtice that euer was vſed towards any:
<pb facs="tcp:13978:129"/>
he being aſſured of my faith, that doth reward it not as it deſerues, but according to his pleaſure, as a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>They all ſate them downe vnder the couert of a ſpreading Oake, where the Gréekes put off their Helmes, whoſe bewties admyred the ſhéepheard, who with ſome ſighes moouing them to ſilence, he began. Since you be pleaſed (Sir knights) to haue me recount the Pilgrimage of my oppreſſed life, and who I am: ſo that ſéeming to receiue content thereby, I ſhall not néed to intreate you to yéeld me that attencion, my manifold ſorrowes do deſerue.</p>
               <p>Know therefore (moſt Noble warriors) how that imperiall power that doth command both Gods and men, pardoning none of no kinde, I meane Loue, ſoueraigne of all ſoueraignes, hath inforced me into this diſguiſed habit: And yet when I ponder how extreamely the blinde Goddeſſe is bent againſt me, I finde my ſelfe not ſecure therein: for I haue ere this bene honored, and as a Prince acknowledged, vntill my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>arre-croſt loues, exilde me through the world. This heart-infecting Deitie (gallant Knights) when in greateſt pompe and iollitie I liued in <hi>Apulia,</hi> (whereof the Heauens allotted me Prince) ſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted thither thoſe, whoſe tongues were tuned with the dulced notes of the gallantneſſe and bewtie of the Princeſſe of <hi>Lucania.</hi> With ſuch déepe roote did her faire name inſert it ſelf within my frée thoghts, that it is now impoſſible to leaue to loue her, in that both ſhe and I haue by a hidden grace, accorded in one thing. But I doubt it is the nature of our climate, or they that breathe therein, by cuſtome to bee ſubiect to like miſfortunes.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I remember <hi>Hanniball,</hi> who had hee not knowne <hi>Apulia,</hi> then had hee not beene inſnared in this paſſion, but béene Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not through loue, ouerthrow his eternall honour, wonne with ſuch loſſe of his owne blood. Yet was not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any force to diuert me from my new imaginations, but rather in greateſt haſte I prepared my iourney towards <hi>Lucania,</hi> whither I went, onely with a Page, my horſe and Armour, ſoly to ſée <hi>Pollinarda,</hi> and if her perfections equalled the fame of her bewtie. I arriued in time when it moſt floriſhed, becauſe the Court was then full of knights that ſerued her. And in faith beleeue me, that how far ſoeuer the report of her prayſes excéeded beléefe, ſo farre and more did I finde them to limp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her excellencies I noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:129"/>In my opinion the heauens haue not created a more abſoluter bewtie, becauſe Enuie it ſelfe hath found no meanes to ſeize thereon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is become the Herauld of her worthes. You may think (Noble Sir) theſe were new ſnares to intrap my captiue ſoule. Aſumptuous try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe was ordained in the Citie, which in auncient times was called <hi>Froſſa,</hi> which in the Aſſyrian tongue, ſignifieth happy. It was ſo indéed, and euen from the beginning, for ſhe neuer had a Quéene, but was alſo in bewtie ſo.</p>
               <p>This occaſion did Fortune offer me (oh ſhe did further me to make my miſhaps the greater) placing me neare vnto a brother of hers: by name <hi>Lyſander,</hi> a knight both young and valiant, and in loue too with the Infant of <hi>Campania,</hi> that in court accompanied the princeſſe <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarda:</hi> high <hi>Soleſia,</hi> no leſſe bewtifull then kinde, who knowing how ſhe was beloued, wold not ill repay <hi>Lyſanders</hi> faith, and ſo the gallant liued in ſome reſpects aſſured of his hopes. Oh, yet neuer had any full aſſurance, if he ſtill will be amorous. On the aduerſe part, was Leader, the valiant Prince of <hi>Calabria, Ageſilao</hi> by name, the happieſt that I knew, in that without the panges of paſſions, and ſoules afflictions, he obtained to be beloued of <hi>Pollinarda,</hi> and in ſuch open manner, that the whole popularitie did know it. It did not gréeue my Ladies father, but rather it ſo pleaſed him, that in open ſhew he expreſt it, which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated the Lady to grace him with new fauours, which were ſharpe poynted daggers, ſtucke in the heart of wofull <hi>Floriſiano,</hi> for ſo am I named. Oh it could not be leſſe, beholding with my owne eyes my own ſorrow.</p>
               <p>At length the Iouſts began, wherein my ſtarres vouchſafed a little to aduance me, which did attract <hi>Lyſanders</hi> affection, with ſuch true zeale, that there cannot bee firmer friendſhip then that hee hath ſhewen me: yea, although againſt his ſiſter.</p>
               <p>The whole multitude turned their gazing eyes on my deuice, which was, blew armes, croſt with yeallow barres. It accorded to the ill my iealous ſoule endured. On my ſhéeld was portrayed ſuſpition in her naturall colour, as in auncient times ſhe was paynted, bearing a ſcrowle, with this word.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:130"/>
                  <l>Wiſely, who can her deſpiſe,</l>
                  <l>That onely doth employ her eyes</l>
                  <l>To ſpie out Loues ſubtilties.</l>
               </q>
               <p>There was no Ladie in the place, but noted my iealous colours, and ſo (as I after vnderſtood) ſome that were more pittifull, prayed for my victorie: which maketh me think their orizons and good will abode me the honour of the iouſts. So <hi>Lyſander</hi> (that greatly affected me) and I, cleared the place, that none wold more aduenture: and hauing don, yet did I not diſcloſe my ſelfe, neither to him nor any other, although the King himſelfe was very importunate to know me: onely this they got, that I was called the iealous Knight. Sure I am, that my Ladie bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo buſied wtth <hi>Ageſilao,</hi> ſhee did not note my déeds, but rather (for it was told me) ſhe was diſpleaſed, that I vnknown, had vnhorſed her Louer in the Liftes.</p>
               <p>Néedes would the Prince <hi>Lyſander</hi> haue mee to his owne lodging, profeſſing himſelf ſo intier a friend, that he hath wonne me to the death: the which I will gladly receiue, to procure his content. In greater bonds did he tie me, altogither expreſſing his much nobleneſſe, by diſcouering vnto me, the ſinceritie of his loue towards <hi>Solefia,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of <hi>Campania.</hi> I could not but highly eſtéeme of the truſt he repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in me, being but a Knight, poſſeſſing nought but armour and horſe. He intreated me to accompanie him that night in a Maſke, becauſe the king his father in honour of the iouſts, feaſted all the Princes with ſhews and reuellings. It pleaſed me in my ſoule, in that I ſhuld behold her preſence that gouerned my heart. In two long robes of cloth of golde we iſſued, maſked: yet would not I go ſo vnprouided, but that I had on a priuie coate, which in my wandring daies I vſed, bearing armes.</p>
               <p>In this manner we entered the Pallace, when the reuels began. Euery Ladie that had her gallant there, fauoured him, to daunce with him. Of theſe was my deare friend <hi>Lyſander one,</hi> whoſe Miſtreſſe was attired in the ſame colour that we were. They daunced with ſuch grace, that <hi>Cupid</hi> himſelfe could not but like it. Next to him, did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilao</hi> take <hi>Pollinarda</hi> Princeſſe of beautie, by the hand. I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie what the heauens had imparted them, for their grace and Maie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtie,

admired all the Hall. Many excellent changes and tricks they vſed, yet the iealous paſſion of my gréeued ſoule ſtirred vp more in my face, by comming and going of my running colour. Had not my friende bene there, rather then I would haue ſuffered it, my heart vpon a two edged ſword ſhould haue bene ſplit, or I reuenged. The beloued youth was famouſed to be an excellent Muſitian, as indéed he was. So his Lady (or rather eſpouſe, for her father had agreed thereto) gaue him a Lute to play thereon. Hee accepted it, (for he was fully bent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme her will) and began to touch it with more ſwéeter muſicke then hee that deſcended to the infernall Vaultes to fetch his wife. Then with a cleare voice he warbled forth this Dittie, the which my memorie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, the more to increaſe my paine.</p>

But being no longer able to indure the peſtiferous plague of iealouſie, on the foure Gates of the Cittie, I ſecretly cauſed ſo many ſhieldes to be ſet vp, wheron, vnder an vnknowne name, I named my ſelf main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of the ring, an exerciſe and paſtime much vſed in that land, by reaſon it is near vnto the Spaniſh ſoyle, whoſe nation, challengeth the ſole preheminence ouer this exerciſe, as ſkilfulleſt and principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof.</p>
               <p>No knight in the Cittie would admit it, ſéeing the <hi>Callabrian</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, vnleſſe I did expreſſe my name, the which, in that I could not do without danger of my life, I graunted notwithſtanding, that any ſhould openly defend <hi>Pollinardas</hi> beautie, which I by another name couertly maintained.

               <p>Valiant was the gallant <hi>Lyſander,</hi> to whom I granted the firſt courſe, whoſe prize he wonne, which was a Pelican, by nature cruell to himſelf, onely to become kinde to his kinde.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proue how many daungers, and perillous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences the diſordinate paſſion of inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Loue doth cauſe, there ſhall néede no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nor preambles of large diſcourſes to auerre it: for the experience that euery one ſuſtaines by paines and griefes thereof, togither with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that famous Philoſopher that ſaid: If this diſordered Motiue of intemperate and furious motions, had not bene indengered in the breaſts of mortalls, as ſome plague and ſcourge for euils, infinit and Capitall deadly crimes had neuer bene committed, nor imagined. Well is this ſaying confirmed by the vnhappy death of the <hi>Calabrian</hi> prince, at the hands of the <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Floriſiano:</hi> who with equal grace and griefe, proſecuted the tenor of his woes thus.</p>
               <p>The bitter exclamatios that ſounded in the Pallace (braue knights) and the hurliburly of the Citie, ſéemed no leſſe, then had it bene round
<pb facs="tcp:13978:133"/>
begirt with enemies. Dead as he was, he was carried to the Lady, ſo ſhe gaue in charge, for louing him ſo dearly in his life, ſhe would not in his death forſake him. She did lamentably bewaile ouer the murthered Corpes, when I diſguiſed came thither, for I could not but go and ſée her, of whoſe ſorrow I had bene the cauſer. Oh cruell heauens (ſaid the wofull Ladie) with what barbarous immanitie haue you extended your rygorous power on me, more then on any Ladie elſe? Oh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge and inhumane wretch, murtherer of my ſoule, may it be there ſhall want Iuſtice, where ſuch bloodie déedes haue abounded? Ay me vnfortunate Prince, how cruelly in thy tender yeares art thou by an vntimely death perſecuted. A thouſand times did ſhe ſound vpon the deceaſed Truncke, holding it in her lappe. So extreame were my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (Syr knights) that to ſée him in that manner, I almoſt became iealous, iudging I had fauoured him, by ſo ſheading of his blood, that in death (were it not ſenceleſſe) to enioy ſo ſwéete a fauour. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my great intyer loue, my ſtate for his I would haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>By little and little I approached ſo neare her, that lifting vp her eyes, ſhe met with him that was cauſe of all her ſorrowe: ſhée ſuppoſing it, cried out aloude and ſaide: Why doo you ſuffer the bloodie murtherer with ſuch preſumption to appeare thus before the murthered? Oh Gods, ſufficient ſtrength, did I then deſire, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to be reuenged.</p>
               <p>Some of the dead Princies Allyes, did ſuddainly ariſe, which forced me without farther regard, to ſhewe my ſelfe guiltie of the fact by drawing my weapons. Aboue fortie ſwords did preſently flie about mine eares. The Pillers of the yarde (whither I was got following <hi>Pollinarda</hi>) defended my backe, whereby hauing ſlaine thrée or foure, the reſt with feare retired, giuing me leaue to returne vnto the place where the Ladie continued her laments.</p>
               <p>There I ſaid I would yeelde both my ſelfe and my weapons into the Princeſſe hand. So ioyfully I reſolued to accompany the dead prince, to pleaſe the Ladie, and therevpon taking my ſword by the point, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated on my knées, I ſaid: Moſt excellent Ladie, if any offence hath bene committed, it hath beene with this, wherewith you may take what reuenge you will on mée, that was the executioner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:134"/>Beléeue me (heroicke knights) there is no crueltie like to that, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led within the breaſt of an angry woman, peremptorily reſolued, for ſo ſhe may haue her will, no life ſhe doth reſpect. She tooke the ſword, and with inraged courage, ſhe offered to execute what I had accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my happineſſe, ſo ſhe were contented: but her ſtrength fayled her in the execution of the blow, falling after the blade in a traunce, whoſe point ſcratching my Front, did let foorth my blood. And though greater wounds then that I had not felt, yet that I noted, when the Lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to her ſelfe, I ſpied my deare blood on her face, as the ſpoyles of her intent. A ſufficient marke was that (braue knights) to aſſwage the greateſt paine.</p>
               <p>Millions of thankes gaue I Fortune for it, attributing that hap to her: for being ſo rare, it could not but procéed from ſuch a blinde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributreſſe of vnexpected benefits. I had no power to defend me from thoſe that aſſailed me, being weaponleſſe, who had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me a thouſand deaths, much more one, but that my friend and faithfull <hi>Lyſander,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the inſtant, who drawing his ſword, approued his friendſhip to be great, by ſhielding me from a ſhamefull death, though not from a rygorous priſon, where the King commaunded me that night to be caſt in, ſhewing himſelfe to be moſt excéedingly angry and grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily ſuppoſe (woorthie Syrs) what I might féele, being in that ſort impriſoned, eſpecially, when the next day I was adiudged in the open place to bee beheaded. I did not ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe to be ledde to die, as to depart in my Ladies diſgrace. Who moſte like an eager Tyger of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> ſtil cryed and yelled out for reuenge.</p>
               <p>But it pleaſed my inconſtant chance, (from whence I gather, I was reſerued to ſuffer greater paines) that I ſhould knowe my Iaylor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a knight both gentle and kinde, whom by deſerts I had bound to pleaſure me: for in former times, I had no leſſe ſaued him then his life, defending it from them that would haue ſpilt it. Hee much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me: ſaying, he would for my ſake vndertake any perill, béeing thereto long ſince indebted.</p>
               <p>His kindneſſe did much comfort me, although I neuer imagined to ſteale from priſon, for all he would haue ſet mee at libertie, for I was reſolued to die louing her, by that meanes working my Ladies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:134"/>
that ſhe might ſée I ſuffered the deſerued puniſhment, on me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for ſo diſpleaſing her. I onely intreated him, by the amitie and loue I had once ſhewen him, ſéeing my death was not to be auoyded, and that I might leaue the world contently, he ſhould procure the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie of a letter from me to my Ladie, for it would be my lateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He had before that (noble knights) heard mee complaine, and vtter my true harts ſorrow, togither with the cauſe thereof: which made him bid me write, for he would with his owne hand conuey it to hers, and alſo get me an aunſwere. To which courteſie I replied. Had I much more done for you then I haue (ſir knight) this your kind offer is a ſufficient ſatiſfaction for the ſame, binding me anew (ouer and aboue your loue) to procure your content in any thing I may: to effect which deſire, oh would I had a long life, that a déed ſo rare and in ſuch diſtreſſe offered and performed, might with ſufficient recompence bee guerdoned.</p>
               <p>Thus animated I writ my letter, whoſe coppie I haue about mee, the which, though it may ſéeme troubleſome to you, I wil read, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the anſwere: and then you will ſay, I haue reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. He drew his letter, and opening it with a ſigh, hee reade it thus.</p>

               <p>Hauing done, to the Court did the Iaylor (ſir knights) high him. He was a man in whom the King and al the Nobilitie repoſed much truſt: ſo might he enter vncontrowlde into fair <hi>Pollinardas</hi> chamber, whom (as he tolde me) he found clad all in mourning, ſtill continuing her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By little and litle in their diſcourſes, hee forced her by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to demand for me: whereto he replied. I was one that momentari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected his death, from whom I tooke this letter, finding it on his Deſke, and ſéeing it was directed to your Highneſſe, I heere bring it to be burnt, leaſt it import ſome further euil. He did ſo cunningly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it, and ſkilfully perſwade the reading, that ſhe thought him igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the tenor.

               <p>He hath reaſon (noble Knights ſaide the Prince, hauing ended) to pine, to languiſh, to trauell without ioy and content, that liued to ſée ſo kinde a letter as mine, aunſwered with ſuch diſdaine and rigor. Who hath euer heard of ſuch crueltie as this? I had no tongue to complaine of her, nor power to banne my lucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtarres. For conſidering how I did offend her, I thought this courſe of wrath too little: But I deſired (ſo dearely did I loue <hi>Pollinarda</hi>) it ſhould bee ſaide of her, ſhee had with greateſt bountie and nobleneſſe, forgiuen the greateſt enemie of her content, and ſole ſpoyler of her ioy, for that had béene a manifeſt token of ſelfe-conqueſt ouer her owne anger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging thirſt, which is the ſole glorie aboue all others, to eternize an honourable minde, becauſe it is generally accorded, that to bee a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter triumph obtained ouer our proper ſelues, then to vanquiſh either heauen or earth. Onely for this is that Ladie much bound to me, that I neuer deſired nor imagined any thing, but to the aduancement of her honor and fame.</p>
               <p>My gentle Kéeper greatly comforted me, knowing how intierly I loued. He performed an act, the which hauing ſince (without affection) often déeply wondred with my ſelfe, yet could I neuer reſolue mee of the cauſe, more then the motion of a vertuous inclination, to comiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a hapleſſe chance. It was, that being throughly gréeued, to ſée I
<pb facs="tcp:13978:136"/>
ſhould the next day be openly beheaded, (againſt which execution, my deare friend <hi>Lycanders</hi> interceſſions nothing preuailed) that entring my chamber with a courage reſolue, he thus ſpake vnto me. You ſée (ſir knight) what the king hath determined on your affaires, it doth ſo gréeue my very ſoule, that to ſaue your life, I would gladly looſe mine, and hazard my credit with his Maieſtie, wronging his repoſed confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in me, and will giue you libertie through this Tower, for it is impoſſible you ſhould ſcape by this Gate, by reaſon of the ſtrong guard that kéepes you. And gréeue not thus to diſcontent your Ladie, for the proceſſe of time will leſſen her concealed ſorrowe for <hi>Ageſilaos</hi> death, better then yours may now ſatiſfie her reuenge. Let it be ſo, and by this meanes reſerue your life, bee it but to imploy it in louing her: for it is not the part of a noble breaſt to diſpaire of euery thing, but it rather belongs to a couragious minde, to nouriſh his decaying hopes with bolde confidence.</p>
               <p>He ſo well perſwaded me (moſt famous knights) that I reſolued to preſerue my life by that ſower remedie. And firſt to comfort him, for the depriuation of his eſtate, which he willingly did forgo to eſcape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with me, I tolde him for whom I vndertooke that daunger, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering my ſelfe vnto him. It gladded him, and therevppon hee tooke off my boltes and Gyues, wherein my aduerſe fortune had bound me, and ſo the night being come, we deſcended the Tower by a corded lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, through a window that ouerlooked the ſea coaſt, where he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a well rigged Barke: entring therein a maine, wee lancht from the Cittie of <hi>Froſſa,</hi> not without many ſighes &amp; teares from my heart, thinking how much I did diſpleaſe the Ladie of my life thereby, in that her pleaſure conſiſted on my death.</p>
               <p>Thrée daies did wee nauigate with a faire gayle, which made mee thinke, I better fared on the ſeas, then on the land. The ſecond time would not Fortune let me repeate it, for conſpiring with <hi>Eolus,</hi> they both would néeds trie their fierceneſſe on my patience, with the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſtorme that hath béen ſéen: for the waues beginning to ſwell, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heauens and ſtrongeſt rockes, what might not we feare, that were toſſed on their billowes, ſometimes hoyſed to the cloudes, and then caſt lower then the center of the earth? So that he which ſuffered leſſe paine, was glad to ſubmit to deaths ſtroke. Such and ſo many flaſhes of water came tumbling into our weather-beaten veſſell, that
<pb facs="tcp:13978:136"/>
full againſt our willes, wee were forced to taſte the ſauor of <hi>Neptunes</hi> ſaulteſt licquor.</p>
               <p>On the ſudden we were ſurprized with ſuch a whirlewinde, that we loſt all hope of recouery, for the perſecuted Barke laie wallowed vp and downe, aboue halfe an houre, vntil a contrary winde ouermaiſtring the tempeſt, caſt it neare the ſhore, and running on a ſhole, it ſplitted in the midſt. Our clamors and ſhrikes then, are not to be beléeued, nor wil I rehearſe them, for my tongue is inſufficient. He that by chaunce got then any aduantage, was by faſtning on ſome péece of boord, a litle to prolong his life. It was ſo hideous darke, that none could ſée the other, nor light any fire could we, for the winde diſpearcing it, would blow it out. Thus grapled on a planke, I left my friend, and wraſtling with the ſeas, fortune, and death: the Gods permitted me (yet I know not why) to ſaue my abhorred life. And about the dawning of the day, I found my ſelfe on the ſandie Hauen of <hi>Argier,</hi> ſo bruſed and tired, that I could not ſtand on my féete, for beſides my toyles, I had not ſlept in foure daies before, ſtill by moments expecting my neare approching death.</p>
               <p>I was willing to take a nappe, before I would go into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, ſo ſtepping among ſome growing wéedes, I ſlept a good while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing a little reſt and eaſe. Quickly was it bereaft mee, falling in the hands of thoſe barbarous Infidels of that Sconſe, that neither pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie nor pardon any, though they bee of their owne ſect, ſo much they truſt to the ſtrength of that their Caſtle. They carried me vnto a rich Turke, Lieftenant of the Fortreſſe, who bought me for two hundreth Chequins, to ſerue him with his other ſlaues. I imployed the vtmoſt of my power therein, which redownded to ſuch effect, that hee truſted me aboue all his other ſeruitors. My painfull, diligent, and carefull ſeruice, came to the kings hearing, that he would néeds haue me from his Lieftenant, paying the double that my firſt Maiſter had done for me.</p>
               <p>I will omit (valiant Princes) how I might gréeue to be ſo hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from Market to Market to be ſolde. It pleaſed my fortune to let me ſo farre obtaine the Kings grace, as that hee let mee go at libertie without bands, but marked in the front as his ſlaue. I learned to ſpeak the language, which much auayled me, would I haue violated my faith conſecrated to my Ladie, for <hi>Troyla</hi> his daughter did euen dote
<pb facs="tcp:13978:137"/>
on me: but to him that had vowed his ſoule to <hi>Pollinardas</hi> excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, and wanting the conſolation of her preſence, that increaſed his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I purpoſe to ſhunne her importunities, once of ſo many times, they had iniuſtly bought and ſolde me to runne away. One night among the reſt, I reſolued to do it, the which I might eaſily accompliſh, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the much libertie I had: yet would I not do it without a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the beauteous <hi>Troyla,</hi> becauſe I would not ſéeme vngratefull for her loue and fauors. You may imagine how ſhe might take it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting me (in my opinion) as her ſelfe: neuertheleſſe, her true loue teares could not ſtay poore diſtreſſed <hi>Iaroe,</hi> ſo was I called by the Turkes. Shee ſeeing me thus obſtinately determined, requeſted to know who I was, then which ſhee required no other comfort: I did not hazard much thereby, and therefore ſatiſfied her. It ſomewhat quieted her, proteſting to come to my kingdome, or neuer to receiue huſband, but at my hands. Therevpon I tooke my leaue, a thouſand times embraced by her, for I durſt not do it, fearing thereby to wrong her, that is the load-ſtarre of my ioyes.</p>
               <p>Shée gaue me more neceſſaries for my iourney then I néeded, and therewith departed from <hi>Argier,</hi> where I nothing got, but like a ſlaue to be marked in the forehead. I could not reſt, ſo tormented was I with variable cogitations, yet in the end I reſolued to returne into <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania,</hi> ſure to be knowne of none, for that my cares, and the troubles of the ſeas, had impaired and altered my countenance, as alſo my ſlaues marke.</p>
               <p>And conſidering how long ſince I was yoaked and captiuated with Loues ſlauerie, I nothing gréeued at the ſignes thereof: for accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them giuen me as by <hi>Pollinardas</hi> hands, I did therein repute my ſelfe moſt happie. In theſe tempeſtuous toyles, and turbulent ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, ſpent I one yeare and an halfe, which was too much to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, though not in my Ladies Pallace. I thought that Fortune (by ayding me with proſperous gales) would now at length ſéeme to pittie me, for in fewe daies I arriued in <hi>Lucania,</hi> where I inquired how matters paſſed.</p>
               <p>I was informed, that one of the ſtrongeſt knights now knowne (the Gréeke Princes that admit no comparatiue, excepted) was thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:13978:137"/>
come. The deceaſed Princes younger brother he was: but farre valianter: for there is no Gyant able to withſtand him. Hee ſolicited and wooed by all means to obtain the Ladies good will, knowing there paſt no more betwéene her and his brother, then an exterior affection confirmed with eſpowſed faith. Yet doth he inſiſt therein, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> haughtie and proude is <hi>Aſternio</hi> the fierce, ſo is he named. Many times was I about to buy horſe and armor, to trie my fortune, which is vnable to ſuffer any Competitor in my loue and hopes. But I let it alone, to ſée to what end my ſlauiſh turkiſh habit would ſort vnto. Sometimes I beheld her, which was no ſmall redreſſe to my afflicted minde, yet was it tempered, ſéeing her diſconted, which pure loue made me thinke was for <hi>Ageſilao.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So one day walking neare her chamber window, I met with my friend the Prince <hi>Lyſander.</hi> Euen from his ſecret cabinet, did my heart leape with his ſuddaine ſight. He ſtayed to looke on mee, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me attired like a Turke, with a turbant on my head, and the reſt of my apparrell neate and cleane, he demaunded whence I was. I aunſwered of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and that by great good happe I had freed my ſelfe from <hi>Argiers</hi> bondage.</p>
               <p>He intreated me (I know not if through affection) to become his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. I agréede thereto, onely againe to trie my fortune that way. Thence wée went to the Pallace, where hée acquainted his new ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitor with his Parents. My Lady was preſent, whoſe preſence made euery ioynt &amp; vain tremble within me, in their ſeueral motion, yet now and then caſting my eyes vnto the Sunne-ſhine of her beautie, I drew ſtrength from it, to ſupport my weake minde, to make reply to their demaunds: for ſéeing me ſo young, in that no hayre yet budded in my face, they comiferated the relation of my troubles, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſlaueries: yet this nothing gréeued me (ſaide I) for I cannot remember when I was mine owne, and therefore ſuppoſing I was marked to no other fréedome, I did till now pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently beare my ſlauiſh bondage, as if I had béene borne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and I beléeue it will neuer bée otherwiſe, my fortunes ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it.</p>
               <p>Gladly would I haue had my Lady vnderſtood it, (ſo ſhee might not knowe me) and with what affection I did vtter it, as hee that

ſo long ſince was wholly deuoted to her perfections. There was none in all the Court but tooke liking in me, eſpecially my Lord <hi>Lyſander,</hi> that fauored me that night to take mee with him, with ſwords &amp; buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and priuie coates, ſecretly to walke abroad, croſſing the backſide of a Gard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> that leaded him to his Ladie <hi>Soleſias</hi> lodging. His kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and familiaritie was a meanes that hee did not intreate mee as a ſeruant, but as if he had knowne me, making mee the Secretarie of his Loues, the ſureſt token of true amitie that may bee in this age. I cannot otherwiſe beléeue, but that <hi>Cupid</hi> now at length thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wronged, ſéeing <hi>Pollinarda</hi> ſo rebellious and cruell towardes him and me. So ſhe that could not loue <hi>Floriſiano, Venus</hi> ſonne with his almightie power, forced to affect poore <hi>Iaroe,</hi> which name I would not change, for vnder that title Fortune had offered me, in obtaining the grace of <hi>Troyla</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Argier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quickly did <hi>Pollinarda</hi> expreſſe manifeſt tokens of her change, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding me whether I néeded ought, if yea, my demaund ſhould be the effect of my deſire. Neither was I able to anſwere, nor did I euer make known <hi>Floriſianos</hi> great neceſſities: but rather perceiuing what ſhe ment, as one ſkilfull in the Art, I ſéemed ſtraunge and regardleſſe of her offer, to be more aſſured of her faith, that after no occaſion might fruſtrate our expects. My ſtraungeneſſe effected what I wiſhed, for by this, <hi>Iaroes</hi> Loue had made her more ſolicit. I doubted not thereof, noting the wooing motions of her eyes. Oh, they be the ſwéete ſilent Ambaſſadors, ſoliciting the ſoules want.</p>
               <p>Many times would I ſet my ſelfe at a window, to ruminate alone the felicitie of my ſtate: then would I ſay to my ſelfe: Oh, who might deale ſome of my abounding fauours with diſconted <hi>Floriſiano?</hi> Oh Gods, how enuious became the Prince of <hi>Apulia,</hi> to ſée <hi>Iaroe</hi> ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and himſelfe vtterly abhorred. Oftentimes recounting my many fauors, I found them ſo infinit, that I was contented to let the Prince ſhare with <hi>Iaroes</hi> glorie and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>One night, (oh happie night among the reſt) did the Lady at full make knowne her vehement paſſions, for I being by my maiſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to watch till one of the clocke, becauſe wee ſhould then walke abroad, I got me in that ſeaſon not farre from her chamber. I thinke there was ſome falſe doore, for when I was giuing thankes to <hi>Cupid</hi> for the benefits I receiued, I heard ſome buſling there. I ſtarted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:13978:138"/>
amazed: and looking what it might be, I ſawe her that now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes my heart, appeare more fairer then <hi>Diana.</hi> A ſiluer Candleſtick with a Taper ſhe held in her hand. With cap in hand (for ſhe was my Empreſſe) I ran to take it from her. Oh loue, to none but whom thou liſts thou doſt diſtribute thy fauors. She plainly (excellent knights) ſhewed her ſelfe to be ſoly mine: for wanting the power to mooue the Organs of her voyce, yet her eyes firmely fixed on mine, ſhe would not let the candleſticke go. Oh Loues ſwéete warre! In faith (Noble Sirs) you would haue ſmiled to ſée the bewtious <hi>Pollinarda</hi> by ſilence and dumme action, confeſſe ſhe did loue, acknowledging his ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and her tributarie dutie to his deitie, granting thoſe fauours as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage of her faith, vnto his ſeruant <hi>Iaroe.</hi> Oh do not ſuffer him (moſt ſacred Lady, ſaid I) ſo much to offend, that was onely created to adore you.</p>
               <p>With this ſpéech, ſhe perceiued the fault ſhe had committed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon with conſent we ſet the Taper on the table, while ſhe replyed. The imagination <hi>(Iaroe)</hi> thou mighteſt ill ſuſpect, of this my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thus to viſit thée, hath bereft me of all ſtrength and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but that thou mayeſt knowe wherefore I come, it is thus: I muſt haue thée tell me thy proper name, for I am ſure thou haſt ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This will I not be denied, vowing to kéepe it ſecret, that thou mayeſt receiue no harme therefore. You may well thinke how I might ſtand confounded with her demaund: aunſwere I could not, which made her more eager to know it. Againe, ſhe vrged me, that I was inforced to ſay, I cannot conceiue (diuine Princeſſe) why you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate to know the thing that will moſt of all others gréeue you: oh let me not be the cauſe to renew your ſorrow, for I will firſt be my own murtherer.</p>
               <p>The amorous Dame replyed: Did I imagine to receiue any, I would not demaund it: but doing ſo, I aſſure you, you ſhall not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more content me, then in that. I aunſwered her thus. Well, for all this, I am ſure (faire Princeſſe) the knowledge of my name will vexe you. Wherefore I humbly intreate you to holde this dagger in your hand, that ending my ſpéech, you alſo end poore <hi>Iaroes</hi> life. Know therefore (ſoueraigne <hi>Pollinarda</hi>) I was borne as I ſaid in <hi>Carthage,</hi> but am called <hi>Floriſiano:</hi> I cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged it, becauſe I heard, that in times paſt one of this name had excéedingly diſpleaſed you, by ſleying the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:13978:139"/>
of <hi>Calabria:</hi> wherefore, ſéeing how hated that name was in this houſe, I durſt not come hither with it, fearing to refreſh therewith, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of paſſed gréefes. Oh excéeding power of loue, for though (Syr Knights) I remembred the things ſhe did moſt loue and hate, ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no whit of alteration, but returning my ponyard, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Little néed had you <hi>Floriſiano,</hi> to alter your name for any ſuch feare, knowing that onely for it, the firſt of the ſame had bene forgiuen. Farther ſhee did not procéede, nor more openly bewray her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>I diſſembled my ioy, ſharing it with <hi>Iaroe,</hi> whom now me thoght began to bee forgot: I would therein recompence him for his former kindneſſe towards <hi>Floriſiano.</hi> The time would no longer permit vs to chat, for the houre of my departure being come, I was conſtrained to tell her ſo. She was content, aduiſing me to be ſecret, becauſe ſhee would that way often viſit me.</p>
               <p>I imagine (Sir Knights) that you thinke both tongue and ſoule ſwore a ſolemne performance of her deare commaund, and if you ſo thinke, I aſſure you, your thoughts deceiue you not: for my ſoule that ſtill hanged vpon her lips, receiued her command, with no leſſe ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Delphian Oracle: then riſing, with a pleaſant ſmiling ſhe ſaid: I pray Lord <hi>Floriſiano,</hi> let vs entreate your Turkeſhip, Chriſtianly to conduct vs to our lodging, and then wéele licenſe your departure. All rauiſhed with ioy, not able to ſpeake a word, I went with her to her chamber doore: and then falling on my knées and kiſſing her hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring her to account me hers: I tooke my leaue, leauing my ſoule in her boſome, and returned to my Lords lodging: where we prepared our ſelues for our walke.</p>
               <p>He did an act, that I iudged moſt kinde, for he gaue me a garment that had bene mine, ſaying: Hold <hi>Iaroe,</hi> for ſince <hi>Fortune</hi> robbed mee of his owner, none hath better deſerued it. I put it on, and greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred how he knew me not.</p>
               <p>Away we went, arriuing to the window where his Lady expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: I ſtayed to guarde the paſſage, with ſuch reſolution, that all the world, yea <hi>Floriſiano</hi> of <hi>Apulia,</hi> had not paſſed there: with the firſt, and with the fauoured laſt, was <hi>Iaroe</hi> now in diſgrace, ſéeing the alteration of his fortunes.</p>

A iuſt guerdon, that ſéeing ſhe would not affect the Knight, that with ſuch firme proofes had approoued himſelfe to be hers, and by his déeds, worthy of her eſtimate, ſhe now beheld the ſubiect of her ioyes, with ſlauiſh markes, and that her blinde and vaine paſſion, might ſo far excéed as to ſay, that for the ſecond <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſianos</hi> ſake, the firſt had bene pardoned.</p>
               <p>There is none that may ſafely build his aſſurance on ſuch effects, if once he haue opened his doores to Loues flatteries. In penſiue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations had the Louer put the Gréekes with his amorous Hiſtorie, that they would not ſo ſoone haue it end. But the youth that aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his woes with repetition of his former gréefes, abreuiated, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There ſtayed I (Heroicke knights) gazing on the veſture that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Apulian, till that my Lord <hi>Lyſander</hi> hauing excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his lady, of certaine obiections layd againſt him, I thinke it was but ſome iealous imagination, they would aſſure all inconueniences, by an eſpouſall contraction, eſpecially befitting them both. So hee came for me to be a witneſſe thereto, but ere he diſcouered himſelfe, he would néeds try the vygor of my armes, comming an other way diſguiſed for the purpoſe: and being neare me, he drew, ſaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:140"/>What madneſſe hath brought thée to ſo ſuſpitious a place, where thy boldneſſe ſhall reape no other againe, then a remorceleſſe death? I was ſo carefull to let none paſſe, nor to diſcloſe who I was, that without more ado, or other anſwere, I ſet vpon my deareſt friend. In faith I reioyced to ſée how wel he behaued himſelfe, although I knew him not, but I being throughly incenſed, I began to follow him in ſuch ſort, that I droue him among the hedges of the Orchard, faithfully diſcharging my dutie.</p>
               <p>It behooued him to ſpeake, leaſt ſome danger had happened, ſo he rayſed his voice, miſcalling me therewith, which more gréeued me, then if he had mortally wounded me: for ſéeing me with eager furie, preſſe to take aduantage at full to hit him, he ſaid. Oh Turkiſh dog, what doeſt thou? I knew my Lord <hi>Lyſanders</hi> voyce, and beléeue me (No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warriors) I was neuer more vexed: but that I tendered him as my ſoule, <hi>Iaore</hi> had ſurely kept him from enioying his loues, yet I ſtayed my hand, conſidering his friendſhip towards the Prince of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I tooke my ſword by the poynt, and intreated him to pardon me, for my not knowing him, had forced mee to commit that fault. The faith (anſwered he) wherewith (friend <hi>Iaroe</hi>) thou backeſt thy Maiſter, brings with it thy excuſe, for neuer had any knight a better ſeruant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I: But that thou mayeſt know how I eſtéeme thée, come, for I will haue thée be a witneſſe to the faith I will plight vnto <hi>Solecia,</hi> to bee her firme Louer.</p>
               <p>Hee bounde mee eternally by the act: And the Moone then ſhyning bright, it ſhyned iuſt in the middeſt of the Ladies windowe where ſhe ſtayed: and credit mee, ſhee ſéemed bewtifull. Shee had ſo affected <hi>Floriſiano</hi> Prince of <hi>Apulia,</hi> that ſéeing mee with his owne garments, ſhee could not but pittie him, calling mee to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
               <p>With my hatte in hand (as a ſeruant ought) I ſtood ſtill, but ſhe called me, ſaying. Come thée hither friend <hi>Iaroe,</hi> for I will haue this aſſurance paſſe in thy preſence, and my ioyes ſhould I account compleate, were the owner of thy apparell in thy place.</p>
               <p>Oh, if that were ſo, my deare eſpouſe (ſayde my tender-hearted fréende) what greater content could wee more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:140"/>Towards whom might the blinde Goddeſſe ſhewe her ſelfe more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable then to vs, had ſhe now ſent vs that valiant knight, croſt with ſo many troubles? Some teares did I eſpie in their eyes, which ſo greatly moued me, that I could no longer diſſemble, and going more neare them, I thus ſpake: My very ſoule would ioy (moſt ſoueraigne Princes) although I loſt this good, to ſée that knight here, who is the happieſt in the worlde to be beloued of ſuch Princes: for then ſhould fortune neither bereaue <hi>Iaroe</hi> of this content, (oh Gods I could ſcarce make an end) nor yet ſhould the diſpairing Knight be ſo perſecuted by her, as not to enioy your happie preſence, &amp; by experience ſée, with what faith he is affected. And if you regard him, behold me here, for more troubles yet reſerued: And ſince I am eye witneſſe of the ſtrongeſt and pureſt amitie that can be, oh let the knight in yealow ſatiſfie it with the like, and with endleſſe ſeruice perpetually to honor you. And wonder not to ſée me thus attired, for the ſucceſſes that haue me befallen, makes me admire how I haue eſcaped with life. I wil not (becauſe I cannot ſufficiently) expreſſe (excellent knights) the ioy thoſe Princes conceiued with my ſight. They imbraced me as I were their brother, yet had I bene ſo, they could not haue done more.</p>
               <p>They plainly had perceiued I was inamoured of <hi>Pollinarda,</hi> ſince to ſuch manifeſt hazard of my life, I durſt aduenture to come to the Court. He ſo richly performed the part of a Noble Prince, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I deſired to be concealed, and not to be intreated otherwiſe then a ſeruant, he alſo ſéemed content that I ſhould affect his ſiſter. Much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did the faire Ladie take my part, ſaying. Beléeue me, henceforth none but I wil ſollicit <hi>Iaroes</hi> affaires, which ſhould haue no il ſucceſſe, ſéeing he refuſeth his other name: ſo wil I procure to redreſſe the moſt difficulteſt, that we may liue contented.</p>
               <p>She forgot it not the next day, going to viſit my Lady in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe found her troubled with many amourous doubts: now miſconſtring of her fauours ſhowne me, then iudging it not ſufficient to my deſerts, and her loue. We departed thence ouercome with ioy, and being in our Chamber, and the Prince laide in bed, I betooke me to a window that looked into the Garden, to recount the fauours I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: where in briefe I omitted none, ſinging vnto the ſilent night, the pleaſure of my conceiued happineſſe, vnable to deuiſe what meanes I might chooſe to be knowne vnto the Princeſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:141"/>She was ſo farre in loue, and therein ſo much out of quiet (no Louer had euer any) that ſhe ouerheard my ſong, and I thinke ſhe gathered thereby, her ſelfe had only the power to glad my ſorrowfull ſoule. And as the Infant <hi>Soleſia</hi> came afterwards, and began to talke of me, ſhe ſo well dealt for me, ſpeaking more then I deſerued, that ſhe altogither made conqueſt of her heart for me: inſomuch that ſhe had almoſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. For that time the Ladie would not preſſe her any more, which if ſhe had, <hi>Pollinarda</hi> would of force explaind her great loue towards me.</p>
               <p>That night which was the laſt of my content, ſhe came to heare Muſicke, and as I alwaies vſed, I tooke my Lute and went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where (not thinking becauſe it was ſo late any had heard me) I began to ſing, and openly to expreſſe the ſoueraigne ioy of my heart, in this maner.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13978:141"/>
not thinking my lifes happineſſe would ſéeke me at that houre. With my ſword in one hand, and buckler in the other, I awayted the ſucceſſe, when in the way accuſtomed, I eſpied that ſoueraigne Ladie, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bewtifull, that with her only ſight, I thought my ſelfe tranſported into the ſkies. Smiling ſhe came, ſhewing the heauen of her face full of ioyfull hopes. She firſt ſaid thus. Methinkes that ſtraunge, and irefull kinde of entertainment, for her that ſoly procures thy content: Oh what ſwéete words? theſe be they that now féede me in this cruell abſence: and more ſhe ſaid thus.</p>
               <p>And in faith I haue not conceiued ſmall pleaſure hearing thée ſing, expreſſing the ſecrets of thy amourous heart: and for the great loue the Prince my brother beareth thée, I wil indeuour (if you tel me who your Ladie is) to get your libertie, that you may better attend her ſeruice.</p>
               <p>With my ſoule full of gladneſſe I replied. It is the condition (moſt ſoueraigne Ladie) of all powerfull Loue to pardon none, among which number, he hath from the beginning ſo ſubdued my heart, that I haue alwaies delighted to treate of his affaires with my ſelfe, being moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: although the Ladie I adore and idolatrize, be reſolued neuer to fauour me.</p>
               <p>I haue not dared euen from the ſpring of my loues, to do more then ſing the ioy my heart conceiues to account my ſelfe hers. Where to ſhe anſwered. And is it poſſible thou art ſo cunning in diſſembling thy affection? Now by my troth, wert thou to be my gallant, thou ſhouldeſt not ſuffer ſo many torments. And beléeue me, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing loſt by diſcouering to the Ladie the interior ſecrets of the heart, and how ſhe is beloued: for otherwiſe thus to diſſemble, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion of further euil, becauſe it is likely, (nay it often happens) that the Ladie may place her affection on ſome other, and ſo thou looſe that benefit, through ſilence.</p>
               <p>I haue alreadie ſet my chiefe happineſſe therein (did I reply) moſt beawteous Ladie, and therefore I cannot but bee ſilent, and loue, although I die.</p>
               <p>Well hath my Ladie vnderſtood what I require, and how I loue: for mine eyes ſometimes forgetting their other motions, repairing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heauen of that bewtie for ſome fauour, are credible Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the hearts intent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:142"/>That is not ſufficient (ſaid ſhe) to make her reſolue to loue, beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued: for as touching your gazing, that is ſo common and generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men, that the Ladies may iudge it as an ordinarie thing, not conſidering the owner of thoſe gazing inſtruments, doth honour and loue her: and therefore it is an error to diſſemble, when the paine is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraunged. If in recompence of the greatneſſe thereof, (moſt ſacred Ladie ſaid I) the author of the ſame ſhould be diſcouered, and ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith, none with more reaſon ought to do it then I, for there can be none that hath indured ſo much, nor any loued with ſuch firmneſſe.</p>
               <p>If there be aſſurance thereof (replied the Princeſſe) I ſay thou doeſt wrong thy Ladie, in not letting her know how ſhe is beloued, if it be with ſuch truth as you publiſh. And therfore becauſe I haue this day heard I know not what of the Princeſſe <hi>Soleſia,</hi> thou ſhalt tell me what I demaund, and on my faith none ſhall know it, but whom thou wilt. You haue no reaſon to binde me to any thing, (excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die replied I) knowing I will till death obey your commaund. Shee anſwered. Why then we ſhall not ſo ill diſagrée as I thought: the thing therefore I would knowe, is, thou muſt tell me if thy Lady be heere or no, and her name withall, without delay and circumſtance: for I ſhall thereby receiue the greateſt pleaſure in the world, and with the contrary, excéeding diſcontent, which will bee immerited, and no iuſt guerdon for what I meane to do for thée? You may eaſily conceiue (va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knights) what conflicts I might indure of contrarious thoughts, not knowing the ſucceſſe that might enſue, if by telling troth, I did condiſcend vnto her demaunde. Somewhat amazed ſtoode I a while, in ſo much that ſhee ſaide: you muſt not deuiſe excuſes, for it will fall out woorſe, if you offend me ſo. I anſwered. None did I deuiſe (diuine <hi>Pollinarda</hi>) but I rather began to incourage my ſelfe, to paſſe my life in your diſgrace, for nought elſe can redowne heereby, but kindle your fléeping wrath. Bee it what it will, (ſaide ſhee) for I am pleaſed with the knowledge. Why then (replied I) know (ſoueraigne Princeſſe) ſhée is in this Cittie, and of the ſelfe ſame name that you are of, in which repitition I offend her. Shee procéeded further, ſaying. And haue you neuer ſpoken with her? now did I tremble with feare, and then imagined a thouſand deuiſes, yet in the end I replied,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:142"/>Soueraigne Ladie, your excellency ſo farre vrgeth this matter, that I cannot ſteppe from hence, fearing to méete with death, vnleſſe you ſeeke his lifes ouerthrow that was borne to ſerue you. She replied: I wil haue you tel me all, for I wil take it as one that procures your good, as you haue partly ſéene.</p>
               <p>Whereto I anſwered falling on my knées: Preſuming on your Royall word and fauours (ſacred Ladie) I cannot deny but I am yours, imploring pardon for this fault (if it be any) worthie of worſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment then death. It did not gréeue her to heare me ſay ſhe was the Quéene my heart had choſen to imperate ouer it, and my ſoule: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking holde by my King (the marke of my ſlauery) which for my pleaſure I often put on, ſhée raiſed me, ſaying: Very plainely haſt thou <hi>(Floriſiano)</hi> expreſt thou loueſt me, and if thy conſtancie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou doeſt it, be as thou ſaieſt, ſo I may enioy a heart ſo ſincere, and ſecond to none, I giue thée leaue to do ſo ſtil, regarding the ſecrecy due to my honor, vntil the heauens ſhall miniſter thoſe meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I may aſſwage thy griefes. I required her hands, I could doo no leſſe, to kiſſe them) more glad, then had I bene inueſted ſole Emperor of the wide world, and yet that had not ſo pleaſed me. She commanded me to take off my King, ſéeing Fortune had now fauoured me, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I replied: Oh let not your excellency commaund me to put off that thing wherewith the heauens haue begun to worke my ioy, leſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enemy to all content, ſéeing me no more a ſlaue, ſhould tryumph ouer my glory: And though I be a king in louing, and the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and frée in being beloued, let me kéepe this as a memoriall: I am and wil be yours while my life ſhall endure, the which looſing it in your ſeruice, will be the happieſt and richeſt loſſe in this terrene Orbe. If it be ſo, weare it (replied the Miſtreſſe of my life) and yet the taking it off, ſhould nothing impaire my affection, which now is only imployed in your Loue.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Soueraigne of my ſoule, weauing this ſwéete webbe of my life, on the delicate Loome of both our contents, when blinde Fortune Miſtreſſe of miſchaunce, being weary and angry that ſhe had helped me that litle moment of time, brought it about I know not by what meanes, that our Loues till then became ſuſpitious in Court, nay further procéeds my woes, (Oh I cannot without teares ſay more) it came to the Kings eares: who deſirous to be aſſured of
<pb facs="tcp:13978:143"/>
ſo diſhonourable a déede, as to be beloued of the Princeſſe, he had hidde himſelfe in that roome vnknowne to me that very night: and ſéeing by experience what he had ſuſpected, he iſſued forth inraged like a mad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I yet was on my knées, when he came forth, and finding me in that manner, he tooke me by the collor, and drawing my ponyard, ſaid: Oh infamous miſcreant, Turkiſh dogge, haſt thou thus wronged the truſt repoſed in thée? The puniſhment inflicted on thée, ſhall bee a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient example to all others ſuch diſloyall wretches as thy owne ſelfe. I had no eyes to looke him in the face, nor tongue to anſwere him, though I wanted not hands to ſhead his blóod, had not my Ladyes and my friend <hi>Lyſanders</hi> diſpleaſure and diſcontent thereby ſtayed me. Hée ſnatched at her ſo furiouſly, that ſhee almoſt fell vpon her face, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>I had not thought (Minion) thy wanton boldneſſe would ſo haue made thée paſſe the limits of ſhame and grace, as to beſtowe thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on a ſlaue? He cried to thoſe that awaighted without, whereat foure knights ruſhed in, who ſtraight conueied me to priſon, where I thoght they would cloſely murther me: the which I had gladly receiued, ſo ſhee were not hardly handled, that had ſo bountifully fauoured mee. The king did commit her, but knowing our affection had beene no other then he had ſéene, hee ſtraight (for hee loued her dearely) forgaue her, turning all his rage vpon poore <hi>Floriſiano.</hi> Oh, magnanimious Knights, with how many millions of briniſh teares did I bewayle that loſſe? it was beléeue me the greateſt in the world, for none in ſo ſhort time could bee ſo happie as I, nor none againe ſo vnhappie. Nothing I did, but exclaime lamenting, and with woes tormenting my afflicted ſelfe.</p>
               <p>At length, being ſo many, ſome pierced the high heauens, moouing the immortall Gods to pittie and comiſeration, appointing a meanes on earth to redéeme me: for the Noble <hi>Lyſander</hi> being mooued at my diſgrace, by pollicy procured my Gailors to releaſe me of my Irons and boltes, that I might eſcape through a window, and ſaue my life.</p>
               <p>I gréeued no leſſe to depart from <hi>Pollinarda,</hi> at that time (though in her grace and fauour) then at firſt when like an enemie I ran from her. Yea more then this did my friend ſollicit in my behalfe: for hee went to his ſiſter, and diſcouered to her the whole ſecret of my affaires,
<pb facs="tcp:13978:143"/>
telling her, I was the Knight in yealowe, and hee that ſlewe her <hi>Ageſilao,</hi> then louing her more then now. I neuer would tell any who elſe I was, becauſe I vowed it from the beginning, onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her fauour or diſfauour, without that regard and reſpect wherein I might bee hadde, beeing knowne to bee Prince of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and had not your valour and curteſies bound me thereto, none ſhould haue knowne it.</p>
               <p>The Lady did not gréeue at this ſwéete complot of Loue, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it kindled in her ſome new affection. So was I viſited in priſon from her: which reuiued my hopes, and added new life to my dying powers. To pleaſure the Prince <hi>Lyſander,</hi> my Gaylors tooke from me my gyues.</p>
               <p>The Lady Miſtreſſe of my life, knew the night of my departure, and hauing ſometimes before written vnto me by her brother, yet then ſhe expreſt the vtmoſt of her Loue: for I was no ſooner downe in the Garden ouer which the windowe was that I leaped through, when among a certaine company of trées I heard a noyſe. Suppoſing it could be none that would do me ſuch pleaſure as I after receiued, I drew my weapons and went towards that place, where I was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacified, ſéeing a knight I well knew: who with as much breuety as the caſe required, tolde me, that my Lady ſent me a Letter with money and Iewels for my eſcape.</p>
               <p>I tooke all, not knowing how to deſerue ſo much good as at her hands I had receiued: and making my anſwere according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe déeds, I tooke my leaue of the knight and went out of the Garden, and trauelled till I thought I was out of daunger, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ſelfe among certaine ſtéepie Mountaines, I vnripped the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſeale, and by the cleareneſſe of the Moone, that then ſhyned, I read it thus.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith feare to bee condemned of too much prolixitie, in the amorous diſcourſe of the Prince of <hi>Apulias</hi> life, being the thing I moſt dread, and onely ſéeke to ſhunne: and yet no ſmall trouble did it coſt mée to refuſe it, to ſo briefe a ſummarie as I haue the which I vrge for my excuſe, although it néed not, if it be read by <hi>Cupids</hi> vaſſailes: but whileſt this is in queſtion, attend (faireſt of all faires) &amp; moſt beauteous Ladies, for the triall of the Tower is nothing but Loue.</p>
               <p>There was none left, but went foorth to ſée it, becauſe the fame therof drew them thither. So many knights came from the ſhippes, that the Cittie was not able to containe them all, and euery one ſo richly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it delighted euery beholder. The ſpacious yard was in a trice filled with people: and the Ladies with their beauties, made it more glorious then the heauenly Synode of the Gods. For the trial, there wanted no knights, in that ere noone, aboue two hundreth ſhields accompanied the others that were before hung vp, yet none arriued ſo high as <hi>Brandimardo,</hi> (ſonne to the great <hi>Affricano</hi>) that died vppon the conqueſt of <hi>Lyra,</hi> in <hi>Roſiclers</hi> preſence, as was declared in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this Hiſtorie. As the Emperours were about to withdraw to dinner, there entred the place, attended on with a maieſticke compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, a couſin of <hi>Abſtruſios,</hi> no leſſe valiant then he. All in gréen armor hee was clad, brauely garniſhed with halfe Moones: the deuiſe on his ſhielde was a Griffion without head, which in his countrie in battell
<pb facs="tcp:13978:145"/>
he had ſlaine. As nimble as a Roe he diſmounted, aſcending the ſtaires in ſuch haſte, that euery one thought he would end the aduenture: but arriuing where the deceaſed Pagan had done, hoe was charged with ſo many ſtrong blowes, that <hi>Galtenor</hi> ſaith he could do no more, then raiſe one legge to ſteppe higher, which was the cauſe that with more rigor hee was thruſt out, and his ſhield placed according to his deſerts, next to <hi>Brandimardos.</hi> Great honor wonne <hi>Salberno</hi> hereby, (ſo was he named) and had in high eſtimation, for (his Couſin excepted, that was borne for the ſeas, whoſe Lieftenant hee was) none could better order a Nauall battel then he, as he ſhewed it in the warres of <hi>Grecia.</hi> The Emperour to fauor the Captaine generall of his Fléetes, inuited him, which they much eſtéemed, iudging the Gréeke Monarch the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteſt accompliſhed in all vertues, of any in the whole vniuerſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: and themſelues moſt happie, to bee ioyned in amitie with ſuch Princes.</p>
               <p>Away they would go, when a kinſman of <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> of <hi>Croatia</hi> ſhewed himſelfe, whoſe armes were of an Indian colour full of ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries. With gallant brauerie hee went towards the Tower, where hee ſpedde not ſo ill, as not to be accounted valiant, for his ſhield was hung next to the Troyan <hi>Oriſtides.</hi> To dinner went the Emperors, glad to ſée what happened in that triall, where they were ſerued with ſuch maieſtie as their eſtates required. By themſelues ſate all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo exceeding faire, that <hi>Paris</hi> had doubted to which for beautie hee might giue the golden apple. Nothing could pleaſe the beauteous <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyſilora,</hi> in abſence of her Gréeke, but rather gréeued to ſée thoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuals, miſſing the preſence of her Prince. She was a thouſand times determined to go and ſéeke him: but ſhee left it, ſuppoſing the fame of the diſamorous Tower would draw him thither, thinking that was he that acccompanied the knight of the <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſo much ſhee iudged him to reſemble <hi>Claridiano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great comfort was it to her to communicate her gréefe with <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> that incouraged her as one that was frée of ſuch tormenting paſſions, and yet ſore gréeued for the want of her deare ſonne <hi>Roſelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> of whom ſhe knew not what was become, and many times ſhee was about to demaunde the wiſe men for him, had ſhee not thought it too much immodeſtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:145"/>She could not but reueale it to her beloued <hi>Dacian,</hi> who diſſembled it as much as he could, yet not without ſignes of inward ſorrow in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoule: he purpoſed to ſéeke him, firſt inquiring of his friend <hi>Nabato,</hi> the place of his abode, the which animated him, perſwading himſelfe hee would haue eſpeciall care of his welfare, beeing the thing that ſo neare concerned him.</p>
               <p>Dinner béeing ended, and the table taken vp, all that companie of Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Knights, with all the Ladies, came foorth to ſée the new commers, that were many, to prooue the Tower. It was woorthie the trauell, and to be deſired, what was promiſed to the victor.

               <p>So many haſted to the triall, that no ſooner one ended, but another was readie. Among them that beſt behaued themſelues, was the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Luſitanian, Archylocus, on Siluerios</hi> brother, whoſe ſhield was alſo equalled with the laſt. In ſuch multitudes were thoſe ſhields hung vp, that the Chriſtaline Tower was almoſt full. Euerie one conuerted their eyes at one ſide of the place, becauſe they had eſpyed the famous <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> Lord generall by land, to whom the Emperour had giuen that honorable charge, in reſpect of what his father had done for his ſon, and he for his Nephew. It was aduiſedly done by the Gréeke, for the world did neuer knowe a better, nor more fortunate Captaine, or more ſkilfuller in ordering of battel, and preſenting it in time. He was beloued of all, and alſo of the Ladies, although he had not ſhewne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe amorous: for he ſaid, there was nothing more contrarie nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to him that ſwayed any publicke commaunde, then to bee in loue, and to bee ſo, it was neceſſarie for a man to buſie himſelfe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in that new alienation, ſetting apart all other cares. Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with moſt of the Nobilitie came the valiant youth, all in white armor garniſhed with knots of Gold and Azure. A gallanter knight had not béene ſéene in that triall. Mounted he was on a Roane Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, with Capariſons of colour like his armes, with ſo many ſtones, that their light dazeled the ſplendor of the Sunne, whoſe rayes reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating on them, depriued the beholders ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:146"/>On his head and his owne Burgonet, great plumes of feathers, full of ſpangles of golde. In middeſt of his ſhield within a groue of trées, hée himſelfe was pictured with his hand vnder his chéeke, leaning vpon a bloodie launce, at his féete lay the God of <hi>Loue</hi> with bow and arrowes, as vanquiſhed by him: on whom he ſéemed to gaze ſo careleſly, as if he held his deitie in naught. The poſſe was thus, wreathed about his launce.</p>

               </q>
               <p>None was more gazed on then the braue Prince of <hi>Antioche.</hi> Oh, how gallant doth he come (ſaide <hi>Lyriano,</hi> who greatly tendred him) and I am glad of his libertie, by reaſon of theſe Ladies that may well excuſe it, for were he in loue, he could not then ſo well guard vs. I am ſorrie (replied <hi>Roſiluera</hi>) that ſo frée a knight ſhould haue any here to take his part, for I knowe not how ſo great a wrong as hee commits againſt Ladies by that cruell deuiſe, may bee ſatiſfied, but by wiſhing the thraldome of his libertie. If the world had another <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoldo</hi> (aunſwered the Princeſſe) it were good that this were in loue, and the other the care to kéepe vs. Leaue we this (ſaid <hi>Roſamond</hi>) to ſée what will become of his libertie.</p>
               <p>By this he was arriued at the Tower, where hee allighted, and drawing foorth his ſword, mounted the ſtaires with ſuch courage, that euery one cried out: <hi>Lindabrides</hi> would be his. One ſteppe he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded higher then <hi>Brandimardo.</hi> There he ſtayed, for hee was charged with ſo many blowes, that hee ſpedde woorſe then any before, although his honour were greater. His mother and the Princeſſes that loued him as their ſonne, made him come where they were, and there the Ladies did diſarme him with ſuch kindneſſe, as if he were one of the Gréeke Princes. To whom <hi>Lyriana</hi> ſaide. I am ſorrie (Prince <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoldo</hi>) that to ſhew vs your libertie, to theſe Ladies gréefes, you haue

ſuſtained ſuch trouble. He aunſwered. Pleaſant is the ſowreſt (moſt ſoueraigne Princeſſe) if my will and deſire bee conſidered, although the deuiſe be againſt my ſelfe, the which ſhall neuer kéepe me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yours. Now you haue loſt the entrance (ſaid <hi>Artemiſa</hi>) you ſhew your ſelfe penitent and ſorrie for your libertie, but you ſhal not thinke to haue anſwered it with ſuch ſmall ſatiſfaction. The beautie of theſe two Ladies had ſomething aſtoniſhed the frée Prince: yet hee replied. You ſhal not néed to deuiſe new puniſhments for him, that muſt &amp; will be alwaies obedient to your commaunds (faire Ladies) and let it be y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, I confeſſe I haue wronged you, that this acknowledgement may ſtrengthen my excuſe, and ſo leſſen my fault, that by purchaſing your grace, I may hope for an extenuation of my chaſtiſement. That might be (ſaid <hi>Roſiluera</hi>) were not your offence greater then may bee forgiuen.</p>
               <p>No more of this vnprofitable that (ſpake <hi>Archyroſa</hi>) for his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will ſufficiently hereafter plague him, as it hath done many others: and let vs now inquire the reaſon of this tumult: whereat they all loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to ſée what it was. There was none but ſaid aloud. The aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is at an end, now the braue knight of the <hi>Lyons</hi> is come. All the Princes turned to ſée his comming, eſpecially <hi>Roſabell,</hi> beeing ſo greatly bound vnto him. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Archyſilora</hi> Quéene of <hi>Lyra?</hi> the changing colours of her face deuoted her alteration, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Prince came with him. Alreadie was this warlike <hi>Mars</hi> paſt the preaſe of people, mounted on a mightie bay Courſer, whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons coloured like his armor, were imbrodered with ſo many ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable ſtones, that the riches of them admired the ſpectators. On the toppe of his helme and horſes head, were large plumes of diuers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured feathers, that the brauerie of both amazed the whole place, that none doubted his victorie. The Emperor <hi>Alphebo,</hi> was he that moſt reioyced, becauſe he had and did greatly loue that Princeſſe, whom he ſo eaſily could not forget, if ſhe had not béene alotted to his brother. In middeſt of whoſe ſhielde, was drawne a world round like a globe, by which a knight climed vp, to the toppe whereof he wanted litle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſate Fortune, reaching him her hand, with this motto.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:147"/>
                  <l>If <hi>Fortunes</hi> hand be not a ſtop,</l>
                  <l>I will attaine the higheſt top,</l>
                  <l>The which, if <hi>Fortune</hi> do deny,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Fortune</hi> is too blame; not I.</l>
               </q>
               <p>No leſſe pleaſure was conceiued at the word then the knights gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant diſpoſition: who with admired Maieſtie paſt on, making his horſe bend to the earth before the Ladies. It amazed him to ſée ſuch diuine bewtie: he ſtood a good a good while rapt in contemplation: iudging it the rareſt ſight in the world: and indéede he was not deceiued, for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo faire were neuer ſéene togither, but there.</p>
               <p>I would be loth (ſaide the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi>) the knight of the <hi>Lyons</hi> ſhould detract much time in gazing on our beauties, ſo that when hée would not, he be forced to looſe the forbidden entrance, not for want of valour, but by his yéelding to loue.</p>
               <p>There is none heere but wiſhes his good in all things (ſpake the Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi>) for by his meanes we were all made ioyfull. Oh, let mee kéepe company with ſuch happie knights (ſaide <hi>Artemiſa</hi>) whoſe diſdaine towards Ladies, nor their comming againſt them ſo openly to approoue themſelues their aduerſaries, in <hi>Venus</hi> lawes, will not diuert their affection from them.</p>
               <p>The deſire they haue to become Louers (aunſwered the Empreſſe <hi>Claridiana</hi>) helpes them to be beloued: but let vs not not looſe the ſight of his high déeds: for I haue great hope of his victorie. There is none here but hath the like, wiſhing it with their very ſoules (replied <hi>Lyria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) and therevpon I doubt not but he ſhould finde ſome one heere that would vndertake the combat about the ſame.</p>
               <p>By this the furious youth was arriued at the Tower gate, where he diſmounted, and ſtucke his launce in the ground, whereat hee tyed his horſe with ſuch beauerie, that euery one applauded his behauiour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:147"/>His ſhield hee tied to his ſaddle pummell, and taking his Axe, with ſoueraigne grace he paced towards the entrance, whoſe paſſage many iudged too ſmall, conſidering his fearefull aſpect. For raiſing aloft his mightie axe, making the blade ſhine with her glittering bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and he beeing one of the beſt proportioned knights on the earth (ſo he were no Gyant) for he was nine foot in height, and of moſt ſtrong and euen compoſed members, all which were apparant tokens of his exceſſiue ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Scarce did hee beginne to mooue to enter the Tower, when there was heard the horrible ſound of new warlike inſtruments, with ſuch cries and clamors of people, that it ſéemed a whole hoſte was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Vpon the toppe of the Tower appeared ſquadrons of armed knights, whence alſo were diſcharged infinit péeces of Ordinance. Many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous ſhrikes, gaue warning that the fierce ſcourge of their houſe was come.</p>
               <p>This is no impediment to forbid his mounting the ſtaires, for as if hée walked on the plaine ground, he aſcended them to the very top, whence new cries rezounded, and newe kéepers were ſéene to defend him from taking the key of the Tower. A good while he laboured in this rigorous conflict: in the end, ſetling himſelfe ſtrongly on his féete, hée paſt his axe into his left hand, and with his right hee got the key, wherewith hee opened the Tower gate, whereat a new alarum was ſounded, which put the battel in ſome doubt. For foure vgly deformed Gyants were placed at the doore, in defence whereof they executed wonders, hauing no other care but to prohibit the entrance. Oh who would not delight to ſée our warlike youth, within the narrowneſſe of the gate, take the axe by the middle, wherewith he miſſes no blowe, and that which he executeth, daunts the place with chill cold feare, but not thoſe that were onely ſet there to receiue them, though the God of battels had diſcharged then, yet could they not bee greater then theſe. Not without great labour and toyle hee thruſt himſelfe among them, where his déeds were admirable: yet he toyled in vaine, for vnleſſe hée cleaued their heads, hee cannot frée himſelfe from them, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſted all their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>But now Fortune was of his ſide, and content that beauteous
<pb facs="tcp:13978:148"/>
Princeſſe ſhould be ſet at libertie, and end ſo many her troubles, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying him, the heauens had ſo long ſince promiſed her: for laboring in this cruell fight, giuing and receiuing mightie blowes, by good chance hee reached one with the blade of his axe vpon the head. Hee cleft it downe to the breaſt, thinking hee had cut a rocke, ſo hard hee found it. At the very inſtant he vaniſht out of ſight, whereby he ſuppoſed their inchauntment lay there.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon hee beganne to ſtretch himſelfe at length with his axe, as a cunning maiſter of his weapon. Euery one in the place plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheld him, for the walles of the Tower were ſo tranſparant, that all was ſéene, what ere was done in the firſt Hall. Some alteration did <hi>Claridiano</hi> féele within her Iuorie breaſt, remembring what troubles and daungers ſhee had indured and paſt, all cauſed by that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Meridian</hi> was alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded in imagination of oppoſed thoghts, which excéedingly gréeued him: for if his ſiſter were liberated, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers large Emperie ſhould be hers: but ſo he might ſée her, hee was content for that time to omit thoſe cogitations, and turned his eyes on the haughtie knight, that repreſenting firie <hi>Mars</hi> within the Tower, had by this ſlaine another.</p>
               <p>The valiant youth made ſure account of the victorie, knowing where their ſtrength lay. So hee extended all his, to end the battell with them, thinking their deaths would ende the enterpriſe. Hee made as if hee feared them, that they might with vnaduiſed haſte fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</p>
               <p>It fell out as hee deſired, and ſo fetching about the ingratefull Athenian axe, hee diſcharged it with the vtmoſt of his furie, on the top of the ones helme, that both it and helme was cleaft to the waſte.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus done, he determined to cloſe with the laſt, but ere hee caſt his armes about him, hee ranne againſt him ſo hard with his ſhoulders, that hee thruſt him from him, with more furie then hee had béene driuen by a culuerins ſhot, and before hee recouered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the vnreſiſted axe did hit him on the head, doing by it as by the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13978:148"/>The Gréeke thought he had now ended his buſineſſe, but it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned otherwiſe: for two knights of gallant diſpoſition, preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before him, without eyther Armes or weapons, ſauing Rapiers and Daggers. They iſſued forth on the ſudden, but with the ſound of millitarie inſtruments, that gaue ſignall to a new fight.</p>
               <p>The one ſaid: Moſt valiant knight, ſéeing the happieſt immured within this Tower muſt not be with Armour, which wee willinglier would haue done, the better to eſchew your furious blowes: but wee are commaunded the contrarie: and therefore, we are forced, and dare not but obey: wherefore, if you will terminate the battle, and thereby conclude the aduenture, you muſt preſently put off your Armour, for our Combatte is permitted onely with Rapiers and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>Somewhat aſtoniſhed was the Gréeke, ſéeing he muſt leaue his Armour, but it laſted not long, becauſe he would not bee taynted with cowardiſe, and ſo hee thus made aunſwere: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (Syr Knights) although it bee no good cuſtome, if wee may vſe our Armes, to put them off in ſuch neceſſarie occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>At that inſtant he ſet his axe againſt the wall, and vngyrting his ſword, and dooing the like by it. The two Knights had ſuch care, and were ſo vigilent to watch theſe two weapons, that hee was ſcarcely diſarmed, when ſwifter thou an Eagle they preſently ſnatched them away, that his nimbleſſe was not able to prohibit it. Hee neuer ſawe himſelfe in daunger of death vntill now: for they of the Tower with thoſe weapons are become more furious then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>They ſaid: Dead art thou Knight, for thy fierceneſſe cannot deliuer thée from our handes. Onely with his dagger did the Gréeke youth finde himſelfe, wherewith conioyned to his inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and neuer daunted courage, hee beganne to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and with ſeldſéene brauery to maintaine what hee had wonne, to the extreame gréefe of all that beheld him: the which, togither with the ſorrow conceiued to ſée him ſo diſarmed, and my ſelfe ouerwearied, conſtraineth mee abruptly to leaue this warre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed,
